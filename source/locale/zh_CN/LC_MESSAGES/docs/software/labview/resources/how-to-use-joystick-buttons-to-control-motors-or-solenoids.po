"As we all get our drive systems working, we are moving on to connecting "
"our auxiliary devices such as motors and solenoids.  With this, we will "
"generally use joystick buttons to control these devices.  To get started "
"with this, we'll go through several ways to control devices with joystick"
" buttons."

"No matter what the configuration, you'll need to add one, two, or more "
"(if you're really excited) joysticks to the \"Begin.vi\".  The first "
"example uses 2 joysticks and the others only use one.  Give each one a "
"unique name so we can use it in other places, like the snippet below.  I "
"named them \"LeftStick\" and \"RightStick\" because they are on the left "
"and right sides of my desk.  If your joysticks are already configured, "
"great! You can skip this step."

"By now, we are familiar with how the joystick outputs the buttons in an "
"array of booleans.  We need to index this array to get the button we are "
"interested in, and wire this boolean to a select node.  Since the "
"\"Solenoid Set.vi\" requires a Enum as an input, the easiest way to get "
"the enum is to right click the \"Value\" input of the \"Solenoid Set.vi\""
" and select \"Create Constant\".  Duplicate this constant and wire one "
"copy to the True terminal and one to the False terminal of the select "
"node.  Then wire the output of the select node to the \"Value\" input of "
"the solenoid VI."
