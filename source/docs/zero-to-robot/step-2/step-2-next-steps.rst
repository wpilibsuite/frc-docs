Next Steps
==========

Congratulations! You have completed step 2 and should now have a working software development environment! Step 3 of this tutorial covers updating the hardware so that you can program it, while Step 4 showcases programming a robot in the VS Code Integrated Development Environment (IDE). For further information you can read through the :ref:`VS Code section <docs/software/vscode-overview/index:VS Code Overview>` to familiarize yourself with the IDE.

Specific articles that are advised to be read are:

- :ref:`Visual Studio Code Basics <docs/software/vscode-overview/vscode-basics:Visual Studio Code Basics and the WPILib Extension>`
- :ref:`WPILib Commands in Visual Studio Code <docs/software/vscode-overview/wpilib-commands-vscode:WPILib Commands in Visual Studio Code>`
- :ref:`Creating a Robot Program <docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program:Creating a Robot Program>`
- :ref:`Building and Deploying Robot Code <docs/software/vscode-overview/deploying-robot-code:Building and Deploying Robot Code>`
- :ref:`Installing 3rd Party Libraries <docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries:3rd Party Libraries>`

Additionally, you may need to do extra configuration that is applicable to your team's robot. Please utilize the search feature to find necessary documentation.

.. note:: It's important that teams using 3rd-party CAN motor controllers look at the :ref:`Installing 3rd Party Libraries <docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries:3rd Party Libraries>` article as extra steps are required to code for these devices.
