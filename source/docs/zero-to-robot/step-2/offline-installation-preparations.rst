Offline Installation Preparation
================================

This article contains instructions/links to components you will want to gather if you need to do offline installation of the FRC\ |reg| Control System software.

.. tip:: This document compiles all the download links from the following documents to make it easier to install on offline computers or on multiple computers. If you are you installing on a single computer that is connected to the internet, you can skip this page.

.. note:: The order in which these tools are installed does not matter for Java and C++ teams.  LabVIEW should be installed before the FRC Game Tools or 3rd Party Libraries.
