Installing LabVIEW for FRC (LabVIEW only)
=========================================

.. note:: This installation is for teams programming in LabVIEW or using NI Vision Assistant only. C++, Java, and Python teams not using these features do not need to install LabVIEW and should proceed to :doc:`Installing the FRC Game Tools </docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools>`.

Download and installation times will vary widely with computer and internet connection specifications, however note that this process involves a large file download and installation and will likely take at least an hour to complete.

Requirements
------------

- Windows 10 or higher (Windows 10, 11)

Uninstall Old Versions (Recommended)
------------------------------------

.. note:: If you wish to keep programming cRIOs you will need to maintain an install of LabVIEW for FRC\ |reg| 2014. The LabVIEW for FRC 2014 license has been extended. While these versions should be able to co-exist on a single computer, this is not a configuration that has been extensively tested.

Before installing the new version of LabVIEW it is recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely co-exist with the old version, but all testing has been done with FRC 2024 only. Make sure to back up any team code located in the "User\\LabVIEW Data" directory before un-installing. Then click Start >> Add or Remove Programs. Locate the entry labeled "NI Software", and select Uninstall.

Select Components to Uninstall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the dialog box that appears, select all entries. The easiest way to do this is to de-select the "Products Only" check-box and select the check-box to the left of "Name". Click Remove. Wait for the uninstaller to complete and reboot if prompted.

.. warning:: These instructions assume that no other NI software is installed. If you have other NI software installed, it is necessary to uncheck the software that should not be uninstalled.

Installing LabVIEW
------------------

NI LabVIEW requires a license. Each seasonâ€™s license is active until January 31st of the following year (e.g. the license for the 2020 season expires on January 31, 2021)

Teams are permitted to install the software on as many team computers as needed, subject to the restrictions and license terms that accompany the applicable software, and provided that only team members or mentors use the software, and solely for FRC. Rights to use LabVIEW are governed solely by the terms of the license agreements that are shown during the installation of the applicable software.
