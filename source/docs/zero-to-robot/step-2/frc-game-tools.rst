Installing the FRC Game Tools
=============================

The FRC\ |reg| Game Tools contains the following software components:

- LabVIEW Update
- FRC Driver Station
- FRC roboRIO Imaging Tool and Images

The LabVIEW runtime components required for the Driver Station and Imaging Tool are included in this package.

.. note:: No components from the LabVIEW Software for FRC package are required for running either the Driver Station or Imaging Tool.

Requirements
------------

- Windows 10 or higher (Windows 10, 11). Windows 11 is not officially supported by NI, but has been tested to work.

- Download the `FRC Game Tools <https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html>`__ from NI.

If you wish to install on other machines offline, click :guilabel:`Individual Offline Installers` before clicking :guilabel:`Download` to download the full installer.

Uninstall Old Versions (Recommended)
------------------------------------

.. important:: LabVIEW teams have already completed this step, do not repeat it. LabVIEW teams should skip to the :ref:`docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools:installation` section.

Before installing the new version of the FRC Game Tools it is recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely co-exist with the old version (note that the DS will overwrite old versions), but all testing has been done with FRC 2022 only.  Then click Start >> Add or Remove Programs. Locate the entry labeled "NI Software", and select :guilabel:`Uninstall`.

.. note:: It is only necessary to uninstall previous versions when installing a new year's tools. For example, uninstall the 2021 tools before installing the 2022 tools. It is not necessary to uninstall before upgrading to a new update of the 2022 game tools.
