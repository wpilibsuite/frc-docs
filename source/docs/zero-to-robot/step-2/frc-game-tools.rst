If you wish to install on other machines offline, click :guilabel:`Individual Offline Installers` before clicking :guilabel:`Download` to download the full installer.

Uninstall Old Versions (Recommended)
------------------------------------

.. important:: LabVIEW teams have already completed this step, do not repeat it.

Before installing the new version of the FRC Game Tools it is recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely co-exist with the old version (note that the DS will overwrite old versions), but all testing has been done with FRC 2020 only.  Then click Start >> Add or Remove Programs. Locate the entry labeled "National Instruments Software", and select Uninstall.

.. note:: It is only necessary to uninstall previous versions when installing a new year's tools. For example, uninstall the 2019 tools before installing the 2020 tools. It is not necessary to uninstall before upgrading to a new update of the 2020 game tools.
