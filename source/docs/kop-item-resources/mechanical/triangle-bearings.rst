**Step 4:** Place your right hand on the bottom of the mount and put your left hand on the top of the mount.

**Step 5:** While keeping your hands in this position, push opposite sides until the bearing is fully in the mount and aligned. 

**Step 6:** When the two bolt flange is fully assembled into the mount, place it on the mounting area of your product. Make sure your mounting holes are 1.75" apart. 

**Step 7:** Fasten your two bolts into each mounting hole and tighten them with your wrench. Tighten with your wrench until the flange is completely secured onto your product. 

**Step 8:** Place a 1/2" shaft into the bore of the bearing. Ensure the shaft can move axially.
