FRC Control System Hardware Overview
====================================

The goal of this document is to provide a brief overview of the hardware components that make up the FRC\ |reg| Control System. Each component will contain a brief description of the component function, a brief listing of critical connections, and a link to more documentation if available.

.. note:: For complete wiring instructions/diagrams, please see the :doc:`Wiring the FRC Control System <how-to-wire-a-robot>` document.

National Instruments roboRIO
----------------------------

.. image:: images/control-system-hardware/roborio.png

The NI-roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC. The roboRIO includes a dual-core ARM Cortex™-A9 processor and FPGA which runs both trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code. Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols (Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and serial) as well as PWM, servo, digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot peripherals for sensing and control.The roboRIO should connect to the dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel for power. Wired communication is available via USB or Ethernet. Detailed information on the roboRIO can be found in the `roboRIO User Manual <https://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/374474a.pdf>`__.

Power Distribution Panel
------------------------

.. image:: images/control-system-hardware/power-distribution-panel.png

The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) is designed to distribute power from a 12VDC battery to various robot components through auto-resetting circuit breakers and a small number of special function fused connections. The PDP provides 8 output pairs rated for 40A continuous current and 8 pairs rated for 30A continuous current. The PDP provides dedicated 12V connectors for the roboRIO, as well as connectors for the Voltage Regulator Module and Pneumatics Control Module. It also includes a CAN interface for logging current, temperature, and battery voltage. For more detailed information, see the `PDP User Manual <https://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/pdf/PDP%20User's%20Guide.pdf>`__.

Pneumatics Control Module
-------------------------

.. image:: images/control-system-hardware/pneumatics-control-module.png

The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor. The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface. The PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the compressor automatically when the robot is enabled and a solenoid has been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and compressor state. The module includes diagnostic LED’s for both CAN and the individual solenoid channels. For more information see the `PCM User Manual <https://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/pdf/PCM%20User's%20Guide.pdf>`__.

Voltage Regulator Module
------------------------

.. image:: images/control-system-hardware/voltage-regulator-module.png

The VRM is an independent module that is powered by 12 volts. The device is wired to a dedicated connector on the PDP. The module has multiple regulated 12V and 5V outputs. The purpose of the VRM is to provide regulated power for the robot radio, custom circuits, and IP vision cameras. The two connector pairs associated with each label have a combined rating of what the label indicates (e.g. 5V/500mA total for both pairs not for each pair). The 12V/2A limit is a peak rating, the supply should not be loaded with more than 1.5A continuous current draw. For more information, see the `VRM User Manual <https://www.ctr-electronics.com/VRM%20User's%20Guide.pdf>`__.
