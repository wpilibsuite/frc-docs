Installing the FRC Game Tools
=============================

The FRC Game Tools contains the following software components:
LabVIEW Update, FRC Driver Station, and FRC Utilities. The
LabVIEW runtime components required for the Driver Station and
Utilities are included in this package. **No components from the
LabVIEW Software for FRC package are required for running either the Driver
Station or Utilities.**

.. note:: The Driver Station will only work on Windows 7, Windows 8,\
 Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. It will not work on Windows XP.

Uninstall Old Versions (Recommended)
------------------------------------

**LabVIEW teams have already completed this step, do not repeat it.** Before installing the new version of the NI Update it is recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely co-exist with the old version (note that the DS will overwrite old versions), but all testing has been done with FRC 2020 only.  Then click Start >> Add or Remove Programs. Locate the entry labeled "National Instruments Software", and select Uninstall.

Select Components to Uninstall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the dialog box that appears, select all entries. The easiest way to do this is to de-select the "Products Only" check-box and select the check-box to the left of "Name". Click Remove. Wait for the uninstaller to complete and reboot if prompted.
