Introduction
============

Welcome to the official documentation home for the *FIRST* Robotics Competition Control System and WPILib software packages. This page is the primary resource documenting the use of the FRC Control System (including wiring, configuration and software) as well as the WPILib libraries and tools.

New to Programming?
-------------------

These pages cover the specifics of the WPILib libraries and the FRC Control System and do not describe the basics of using the supported programming languages. If would like resources on learning the supported programming languages check out the recommendations below:

.. note:: You can continue with this Getting Started section to get a functioning basic robot without knowledge of the programming language. To go beyond that, you will need to be familiar with the language you choose to program in.

0 to Robot
----------
The remaining pages in this Getting Started section are designed to be completed in order to go from 0 to a working basic robot. The documents will walk you through installation of all needed software, wiring and configuration of hardware, and loading a basic example program that should allow your robot to operate. When you complete a page, simply click **Next** to navigate to the next page and continue with the process. When you're done, you can click **Next** to continue to an overview of WPILib in C++\Java or jump back to the home page using the logo at the top left to explore the rest of the content.
