Software Component Overview
===========================

The FRC\ |reg| software consists of a wide variety of mandatory and optional components. These elements are designed to assist you in the design, development, and debugging of your robot code as well as assist with control robot operation and to provide feedback when troubleshooting. For each software component this document will provide a brief overview of its purpose, a link to the package download, if appropriate, and a link to further documentation where available.

Operating System Compatibility
------------------------------

The primary supported OS for FRC components is Windows. All required FRC software components have been tested on Windows 10 & 11.

Many of the tools for C++/Java programming are also supported and tested on macOS and Linux. Teams programming in C++/Java should be able to develop using these systems, using a Windows system for the Windows-only operations such as the Driver Station, Radio Configuration Utility, and roboRIO Imaging Tool.

LabVIEW FRC (Windows Only)
--------------------------

   :alt: LabVIEW FRC Getting Started screen.

LabVIEW FRC, based on a recent version of LabVIEW Professional, is one of the three officially supported languages for programming an FRC robot. LabVIEW is a graphical, dataflow-driven language. LabVIEW programs consist of a collection of icons, called VIs, wired together with wires which pass data between the VIs. The LabVIEW FRC installer is distributed on a DVD found in the Kickoff Kit of Parts and is also available for download.  A guide to getting started with the LabVIEW FRC software, including installation instructions can be found :ref:`here <docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/labview-setup:Installing LabVIEW for FRC (LabVIEW only)>`.

Visual Studio Code
------------------

   :alt: LiveWindow showing two different subsystems.

LiveWindow is a feature of SmartDashboard and Shuffleboard, designed for use with the Test Mode of the Driver Station. LiveWindow allows the user to see feedback from sensors on the robot and control actuators independent of the written user code. More information about LiveWindow can be found :ref:`here <docs/software/dashboards/smartdashboard/test-mode-and-live-window/index:SmartDashboard: Test Mode and Live Window>`.

FRC roboRIO Imaging Tool (Windows Only)
---------------------------------------
