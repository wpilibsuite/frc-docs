# New for 2026

A number of improvements have been made to FRC\ |reg| Control System software for 2026. This article will describe and provide a brief overview of the new changes and features as well as a more complete changelog for Java/C++ WPILib changes. This document only includes the most relevant changes for end users, the full list of changes can be viewed on the various [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/) GitHub repositories.

It's recommended to also review the list of :doc:`known issues <known-issues>`.

## Importing Projects from Previous Years

Due to internal GradleRIO changes, it is necessary to update projects from previous years. After :doc:`Installing WPILib for 2026 </docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup>`, any 2025 projects must be :doc:`imported </docs/software/vscode-overview/importing-last-years-robot-code>` to be compatible.

## Major Changes (Java/C++)

.. note:: The WPILib team is heavily working on the 2027 Systemcore control system, and thus there are less changes for 2026 then in previous years.

Supported Operating Systems and Architectures:
 * Windows 10 & 11, 64 bit only. 32 bit and Arm are not supported
 * Ubuntu 22.04 & 24.04, 64 bit. Other Linux distributions with glibc >= 2.34 may work, but are unsupported
 * macOS 13.3 or higher, both Intel and Arm.

.. warning:: The following OSes are no longer supported: macOS 12 or earlier, Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and any 32-bit Windows.

.. note:: [Windows 10 support from Microsoft ended in October 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support). We intend to continue supporting Windows 10 through the 2026 season, but may have to drop support in 2027. Teams should start planning their upgrade path to Windows 11.
