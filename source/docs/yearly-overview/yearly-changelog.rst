New for 2022
============

.. important:: Due to the large number of breaking and substantial changes between 2021 and 2022, it is advised that existing teams thoroughly read this document!

A number of improvements have been made to FRC\ |reg| Control System software for 2022. This article will describe and provide a brief overview of the new changes and features as well as a more complete changelog for Java/C++ WPILib changes. This document only includes the most relevant changes for end users, the full list of changes can be viewed on the various `WPILib <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/>`__ GitHub repositories. WPILib recognizes that some of these changes may cause teams issues in the short term upgrading. We expect it to pay off over the long term as we better improve the internals of WPILib.

Due to internal GradleRIO changes, it is necessary to update previous years projects. After :doc:`Installing WPILib for 2022 </docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup>`, any 2020 or 2021 projects must be :doc:`imported </docs/software/vscode-overview/importing-gradle-project>` to be compatible.

Major Changes (Java/C++)
------------------------

These changes contain *some* of the major changes to the library that it's important for the user to recognize. This does not include all of the breaking changes, see the other sections of this document for more changes.

- Drive class functions such as ``DifferentialDrive`` **no longer invert** the right side by default. Please use ``setInverted`` on your motor controllers to invert the right side to maintain the same behavior
- Old Command-Based has been removed from the list of new templates in VS Code. Please migrate to the new Command-Based library. The Old Command Based remains available to support existing code.
- IterativeRobot has been removed. Please use the TimedRobot template instead

WPILib
------

General Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Rewrite :doc:`Mechanism2d </docs/software/dashboards/glass/mech2d-widget>` to utilize NetworkTables
- Improved the error message when a program crashes
- Added support for DMA to Java
- Added ``TimesliceRobot`` project template. This allows users to timeslice schedule periodic functions
- Added C++ TankDrive example
- Added ``PS4Controller`` controller class
- Added better message for when an I2C port is out of range
- Added ``Debouncer`` (`Java <https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/development/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/Debouncer.html>`__/ `C++ <https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/development/cpp/classfrc_1_1Debouncer.html>`__) class. This helps with filtering rising and falling edges when dealing with boolean values
- Added ``PneumaticsHub`` class for use with the REV Pneumatics Hub
- GenericHID has been updated to static functions for non-defined controller types
-  ``getInstance()`` functions in ``CameraServer``, ``DriverStation``, ``LiveWindow``, ``Preferences``, ``SendableRegistry``, have been deprecated and replaced with static functions
- ``Timer::HasPeriodPassed()`` and ``Timer.hasPeriodPassed()`` have been deprecated. Use ``AdvanceIfElapsed()`` instead

Breaking Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``PDP`` is now ``PowerDistribution``
- Various ``PCM`` related classes (Solenoid, Compressor) now require a ``PneumaticsModuleType``
- Sendable has been broken up into NT and non-NT components. This will make it easier for vendors and external libraries to integrate sendable.
- ``InterruptableSendableBase`` has been broken up
  - ``AsynchronousInterrupt``
  - ``SynchronousInterrupt``
- ``DriverStation.reportWarning`` and ``DriverStation.reportError`` have been removed. See the ``Errors.h`` header
- ``RobotDrive`` has been removed
- ``GearTooth`` has been removed
- ``SpeedController`` has been renamed to ``MotorController``
- Various DriverStation In[Mode] functions has been renamed (IE: ``InDisabled`` -> ``inDisabled``)
- Deprecated ``wpilibj.cameraserver`` has been removed. Use ``cameraserver`` instead
- ``WPILib.h`` has been removed. Please only include what you need
- C++: ``wpi::StringRef`` is replaced with ``std::string_view``. This is a drop in replacement in most cases
- C++: ``wpi::ArrayRef`` is replaced with ``wpi::span``. This is a modified backport of the C++20 ``std::span``
- C++: ``wpi::Twine`` is replaced with `fmtlib <https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html>`__. It has more features and is standard in C++20

.. dropdown:: Various C++ classes have migrated to use units. Below are a list of effected classes.

   - ``Ultrasonic``
   - ``CommandScheduler``
   - ``CommandState``
   - ``WaitUntilCommand``
   - ``MecanumControllerCommand``
   - ``RamseteCommand``
   - ``SwerveControllerCommand``
   - ``TrapezoidProfileCommand``
   - ``WaitCommand``
   - ``Command`` (Old Commands)
   - ``CommandGroup`` (Old Commands)
   - ``CommandGroupEntry`` (Old Commands)
   - ``TimedCommand`` (Old Commands)
   - ``WaitCommand`` (Old Commands)
   - ``WaitForChildren`` (Old Commands)
   - ``WaitUntilCommand`` (Old Commands)
   - ``Counter``
   - ``CounterBase``
   - ``DriverStation``
   - ``Encoder``
   - ``InterruptableSensorBase``
   - ``MotorSafety``
   - ``Notifier``
   - ``SPI``
   - ``SerialPort``
   - ``SlewRateLimiter``
   - ``Solenoid``
   - ``Timer``
   - ``Watchdog``

Package Renames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have committed to several organizational renames that will allow us greater flexible with new classes in the future. The VS Code project importer will update existing projects to use the new packages/headers.

- ``controller`` is now ``math.controller``
- ``wpiutil`` is now ``util``
- ``SlewRateLimiter``, ``LinearFilter``, and ``MedianFilter`` now live in ``math.filters``
- ``Timer`` has moved from ``frc2`` to ``frc``
- Motor controllers (``VictorSPX``, ``PWMSparkMax``, etc) have been moved to a ``motorcontrol`` package.

Axon
----

We have made a new tool for machine learning in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Axon allows users to view and create datasets, train machine learning models, test your models within the browser-based GUI, and export them for use on a Raspberry Pi. Detecting complex objects (such as hatch panels and other robots) has never been easier and an end-to-end user guide is available in the :doc:`WPILib docs </docs/software/wpilib-tools/axon/index>`. Axon provides the functionality to train machine learning models to recognize any object you want (defined in a homemade dataset), or generic objects such as cats, airplanes, and hot dogs.

Axon is a replacement for the previous AWS-based Jupyter Notebook solution released in the 2019 season. Axon has a smooth installation and user experience overall, and a much more friendly GUI for beginners and experts alike.

Running machine learning models on the WPILib Raspberry Pi image has never been easier either; the new Python script for the Pi features time-synchronous NetworkTables data streaming, as well as a better quality live inference MJPEG stream.
