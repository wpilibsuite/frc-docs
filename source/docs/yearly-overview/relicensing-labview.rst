Re-licensing LabVIEW for 2021 Season
====================================

For the 2021 season we have chosen to remain on LabVIEW for FRC\ |reg| 2020 (based on LabVIEW 2019) in order to minimize changes for teams in a year where robot re-use is expected. Because this was not anticipated when the 2020 licenses were issued, teams will need to re-license their software with an updated license.

License Manager
---------------
Locate and run the NI License Manager software, either from the Start menu, or from ``Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\Shared\License Manager``. Then click :guilabel:`Local Licenses` in the top menu bar.
