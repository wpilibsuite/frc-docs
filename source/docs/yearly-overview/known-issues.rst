Known Issues
============

This article details known issues (and workarounds) for FRC\ |reg| Control System Software.

Open Issues
-----------

Onboard I2C Causing System Lockups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** Use of the onboard I2C port, in any language, can result in system lockups. The frequency of these lockups appears to be dependent on the specific hardware (i.e. different roboRIOs will behave differently) as well as how the bus is being used.

**Workaround:** The only surefire mitigation is to use the MXP I2C port instead. Acessing the device less frequently and/or using a different roboRIO may significantly reduce the likelihood/frequency of lockups, it will be up to each team to assess their tolerance of the risk of lockup. This lockup can not be definitively identified on the field and a field fault will not be called for a match where this behavior is believed to occur. This lockup is a CPU/kernel hang, the roboRIO will completely stop responding and will not be accessible via the DS, webpage or SSH. If you can access your roboRIO via any of these methods, you are experiencing a different issue.

Invalid build due to missing GradleRIO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** Rarely, a user's Gradle cache will get broken and they will get shown errors similar to the following:

.. code-block:: console

   Could not apply requested plugin [id: ‘edu.wpi.first.GradleRIO’, version: ‘2020.3.2’] as it does not provide a plugin with id ‘edu.wpi.first.GradleRIO’

**Workaround:**

Delete your Gradle cache located under ``~$USER_HOME/.gradle``. Windows machines may need to enable the ability to `view hidden files <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5>`__. This issue has only shown up on Windows so far. Please `report <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/frc-docs/issues/new>`__ this issue if you get it on an alternative OS.

Chinese characters in Driver Station Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** Rarely, the driver station log will show Chinese characters instead of the English text. This appears to only happen when Windows is set to a language other then English.

  :alt: Chinese character appearing in the Driver Station log window.

**Workaround:**
There are two known workarounds:

  #. Copy and paste the Chinese characters into notepad, and the English text will be shown.
  #. Temporarily change the Windows language to English.

C++ Intellisense - Files Open on Launch Don't Work Properly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** In C++, files open when VS Code launches will have issues with Intellisense showing suggestions from all options from a compilation unit and not just the appropriate ones or not finding header files. This is a bug in VS Code.

**Workaround:**

  #. Close all  files in VS Code, but leave VS Code open
  #. Delete c_cpp_properties.json file in the .vscode folder, if it exists
  #. Run the "Refresh C++ Intellisense" command in vscode.
  #. In the bottom right you should see something that looks like a platform (linuxathena or windowsx86-64 etc). If it’s not linuxathena click it and set it to linuxathena (release)
  #. Wait ~1 min
  #. Open the main cpp file (not a header file). Intellisense should now be working

Issues with WPILib Dashboards and Simulation on Windows N Editions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** WPILib code using CSCore (dashboards and simulated robot code) will have issues on Education N editions of Windows.

- Shuffleboard will run, but not load cameras
- Smartdashbard will crash on start-up
- Robot Simulation will crash on start-up

**Solution:** Install the `Media Feature Pack <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack>`__

NetworkTables Interoperability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is currently an issue with inter-operating C++/Java :term:`NetworkTables` clients (dashboards or co-processors) with LabVIEW servers (LV robot code). In some scenarios users will see updates from one client fail to be replicated across to other clients (e.g. data from a co-processor will not be properly replicated out to a dashboard). Data still continues to return correctly when accessed by code on the server.

**Workaround**: Write code on the server to mirror any keys you wish to see on other clients (e.g. dashboards) to a separate key. For example, if you have a key named ``targetX`` being published by a co-processor that you want to show up on a dashboard, you could write code on the robot to read the key and re-write it to a key like ``targetXDash``.
