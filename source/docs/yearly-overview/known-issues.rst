Known Issues
============

This article details known issues (and workarounds) for FRC\ |reg| Control System Software.

Open Issues
-----------

No Encoder Noise for Certain Simulation Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Issue:** The position getters for certain simulation classes (``ElevatorSim`` in C++, ``SingleJointedArmSim`` in C++ and Java) will not add measurement noise as configured in the constructor.

**Workaround:** Use the ``getOutput(0)`` (Java) / ``GetOutput(0)`` (C++) method on the simulation class instead.

Chinese characters in Driver Station Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** Rarely, the driver station log will show Chinese characters instead of the English text. This appears to only happen when Windows is set to a language other then English.

**Workaround:**
There are two known workarounds:

  #. Copy and paste the Chinese characters into notepad, and the English text will be shown.
  #. Temporarily change the Windows language to English.

C++ Intellisense - Files Open on Launch Don't Work Properly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** In C++, files open when VS Code launches will have issues with Intellisense showing suggestions from all options from a compilation unit and not just the appropriate ones or not finding header files. This is a bug in VS Code.

**Workaround:**

  #. Close all  files in VS Code, but leave VS Code open
  #. Delete c_cpp_properties.json file in the .vscode folder, if it exists
  #. Run the "Refresh C++ Intellisense" command in vscode.
  #. In the bottom right you should see something that looks like a platform (linuxathena or windowsx86-64 etc). If itâ€™s not linuxathena click it and set it to linuxathena (release)
  #. Wait ~1 min
  #. Open the main cpp file (not a header file). Intellisense should now be working

SmartDashboard and Simulation fail to launch on Windows N Editions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Issue:** WPILib code using CSCore (dashboards and simulated robot code) will fail to launch on Education N editions of Windows.

**Solution:** Install the `Media Feature Pack <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack>`__

NetworkTables Interoperability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is currently an issue with inter-operating C++/Java Network Tables clients (dashboards or co-processors) with LabVIEW servers (LV robot code). In some scenarios users will see updates from one client fail to be replicated across to other clients (e.g. data from a co-processor will not be properly replicated out to a dashboard). Data still continues to return correctly when accessed by code on the server.

**Workaround**: Write code on the server to mirror any keys you wish to see on other clients (e.g. dashboards) to a separate key. For example, if you have a key named ``targetX`` being published by a co-processor that you want to show up on a dashboard, you could write code on the robot to read the key and re-write it to a key like ``targetXDash``.
