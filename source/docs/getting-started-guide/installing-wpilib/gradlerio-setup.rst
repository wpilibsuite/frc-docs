# Setting up GradleRIO

GradleRIO is the build system used to compile and deploy code to your robot. It's automatically included and configured when you use the WPILib installer and create a new robot project.

## What is GradleRIO?

GradleRIO is a Gradle plugin that:

- Compiles your robot code
- Manages dependencies and libraries
- Deploys code to the roboRIO
- Runs simulations
- Executes unit tests

## Automatic Configuration

When you create a new robot project using the WPILib project creator, GradleRIO is automatically configured with:

- Correct WPILib version
- Proper compiler settings
- Deployment configuration
- Team number
- Robot class references

## Build Configuration File

Your robot project includes a ``build.gradle`` file that contains GradleRIO configuration. This file is automatically generated and typically doesn't need manual editing for basic projects.

## Common GradleRIO Commands

GradleRIO provides several useful commands accessible through VS Code or the command line:

- **Deploy**: Builds and deploys your code to the roboRIO
- **Simulate**: Runs robot simulation
- **Test**: Runs unit tests
- **Build**: Compiles code without deploying

These commands are available in the VS Code WPILib command palette (press **Ctrl+Shift+P** or **Cmd+Shift+P**).

## Next Steps

With GradleRIO set up automatically in your project, you're ready to move on to :doc:`creating-new-project` to create your first robot program.

For advanced GradleRIO configuration, see :doc:`/docs/software/advanced-gradlerio/index` in the User Manual.
