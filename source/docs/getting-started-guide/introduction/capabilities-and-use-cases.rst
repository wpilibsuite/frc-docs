# Capabilities and Use Cases

WPILib provides a comprehensive software framework for building FRC\ |reg| robots. This page covers what you can do with WPILib and various use cases for learning and development.

## What Can You Build?

WPILib supports:

- **Competition Robots**: Full-sized FRC robots with complex mechanisms and autonomous routines
- **Practice Platforms**: Small-scale robots like XRP and Romi for learning programming fundamentals
- **Simulation**: Test and develop code without physical hardware
- **Prototyping**: Quick iteration on robot designs and control strategies

## XRP Robot Platform

The XRP (eXperiential Robotics Platform) is an affordable, small-scale robot platform perfect for:

- Learning WPILib programming at home
- Testing algorithms before deploying to competition robots
- Education and training for new team members
- Off-season skill development

For more information, see the :doc:`/docs/xrp-robot/index` documentation.

## Romi Robot Platform

The Romi is another excellent learning platform that provides:

- Compact, desk-sized robotics platform
- Real hardware control without a full-sized robot
- Integration with WPILib simulation
- Educational tool for programming fundamentals

For more information, see the :doc:`/docs/romi-robot/index` documentation.

## Simulation Environment

WPILib includes powerful simulation capabilities that allow you to:

- Test code without physical hardware
- Visualize robot behavior
- Debug complex autonomous routines
- Develop during off-season or when robot access is limited

## Competition Robot Development

For full-sized competition robots, WPILib provides:

- Motor control for various motor controllers
- Sensor integration (encoders, gyros, vision cameras)
- Autonomous path planning
- Command-based programming framework
- Dashboard and telemetry tools
- Network communication via NetworkTables
