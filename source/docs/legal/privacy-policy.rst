# Privacy Policy

WPILib is a project developed by volunteers who are largely based in the United States.  We take privacy seriously and collect only the minimum amount of information needed to support our mission of providing user-friendly libraries and software tools to enable FIRST Robotics Competition teams to be successful in writing software for their robots.

## Information We Collect

WPILib-developed desktop applications do not collect personal information.  They do create and store logs of application errors and user interactions on the user's system, but this data is not shared online unless the user takes action to upload or share it.

The WPILib libraries do not collect personal information.  When run on the roboRIO, the libraries collect limited metrics data (“usage reporting”) regarding what pieces of the libraries are used by the deployed software (user-written code linked to the WPILib libraries).  Only when the robot code is running and connected to the competition field at a FIRST Robotics Competition event is this information shared with and stored by the Field Management System.  This information is associated solely with the FRC team and not with any individual.  An anonymized (team number removed) version of this metrics data is publicly shared by FIRST after each competition season, and is used to inform future development of library features.

## Third-Party Data Collection

WPILib uses and installs a number of third-party applications, each of which has their own privacy policy.  We also use a variety of third-party services for distribution of WPILib software, each of which has their own privacy policy, detailed below.

### GitHub

The WPILib source code repositories are hosted by GitHub.  The WPILib Visual Studio Code extension also connects to GitHub for online browsing of vendor dependency updates.

### ReadTheDocs (docs.wpilib.org)

Our online documentation site is hosted by ReadTheDocs.

### JFrog Artifactory

WPILib uses a JFrog-hosted Artifactory instance for distribution of WPILib software components.  If a build is performed while connected to the Internet, Artifactory may be contacted to check for and download updates.

[JFrog Privacy Policy](https://jfrog.com/privacy-notice/)

### Gradle

WPILib uses Gradle to build robot projects.  If a build is performed while connected to the Internet, Gradle may check for updates to software components and will upload information about the build to its services.

[Gradle Privacy Policy](https://gradle.com/legal/privacy/)

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a desktop application that is separately distributed by Microsoft.  The WPILib installer prompts to download and install Visual Studio Code as part of the installation process.  Visual Studio Code auto-updates are disabled by the WPILib installer, but crash reporting and usage reporting are still enabled by default.

### AdvantageScope

The AdvantageScope desktop application is distributed and installed with the WPILib installer.
