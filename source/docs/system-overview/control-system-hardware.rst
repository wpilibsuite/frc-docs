FRC Control System Hardware Overview
====================================

The goal of this document is to provide a brief overview of the hardware
components that make up the FRC Control System. Each component will
contain a brief description of the component function, a brief listing
of critical connections, and a link to more documentation if available.
Note that for complete wiring instructions/diagrams, please see the
Wiring the FRC Control System document.

National Instruments roboRIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image0|

The NI-roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC. The roboRIO
includes a dual-core ARM Cortex™-A9 processor and FPGA which runs both
trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code.
Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols
(Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and serial) as well as PWM, servo,
digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot
peripherals for sensing and control.The roboRIO should connect to the
dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel for power. Wired
communication is available via USB or Ethernet. Detailed information on
the roboRIO can be found in the `roboRIO User
Manual <http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/374474a.pdf>`__.

Power Distribution Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) is designed to distribute power from
a 12VDC battery to various robot components through auto-resetting
circuit breakers and a small number of special function fused
connections. The PDP provides 8 output pairs rated for 40A continuous
current and 8 pairs rated for 30A continuous current. The PDP provides
dedicated 12V connectors for the roboRIO, as well as connectors for the
Voltage Regulator Module and Pneumatics Control Module. It also includes
a CAN interface for logging current, temperature, and battery voltage.
For more detailed information, see the[ PDP User
Manual](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/pdp.html#product_tabs_technical_resources
" PDP User Manual").

Pneumatics Control Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image2|

The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required
to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor.
The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface. The
PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the
compressor automatically when the robot is enabled and a solenoid has
been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic
information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and
compressor state. The module includes diagnostic LED’s for both CAN and
the individual solenoid channels. For more information see the `PCM User
Manual <http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/pcm.html#product_tabs_technical_resources>`__.

Voltage Regulator Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image3|

The VRM is an independent module that is powered by 12 volts. The device
is wired to a dedicated connector on the PDP. The module has multiple
regulated 12V and 5V outputs. The purpose of the VRM is to provide
regulated power for the robot radio, custom circuits, and IP vision
cameras. **Note: The two connector pairs associated with each label have
a combined rating of what the label indicates (e.g. 5V/500mA total for
both pairs not for each pair). The 12V/2A limit is a peak rating, the
supply should not be loaded with more than 1.5A continuous current
draw.**\ For more information, see the `VRM User
Manual <http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/vrm.html#product_tabs_technical_resources>`__.

Motor Controllers

Either the OpenMesh OM5P-AN or OpenMesh OM5P-AC wireless radio is used
as the robot radio to provide wireless communication functionality to
the robot. The device can be configured as an Access Point for direct
connection of a laptop for use at home. It can also be configured as a
bridge for use on the field. The robot radio should be powered by one of
the 12V/2A outputs on the VRM and connected to the roboRIO controller
over Ethernet. For more information, see Programming your radio for home
use and the `Open Mesh OM5P-AC product

robot power switch and a protection device for downstream robot wiring
and components. The 120A circuit breaker is wired to the positive
terminals of the robot battery and Power Distribution boards. For more
information, please see the `Cooper Bussmann 18X Series Datasheet (PN:
185120F) <http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/dam/public/bussmann/Transportation/Circuit%20Protection/resources/datasheets/BUS_Tns_DS_18X_CIRCUITBREAKER.pdf>`__

Snap Action Circuit Breakers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image20|

The Snap Action circuit breakers, MX5-A40 and VB3 series, are used with
the Power Distribution Panel to limit current to branch circuits. The
MX5-A40 40A MAXI style circuit breaker is used with the larger channels
on the Power Distribution Panel to power loads which draw current up to
40A continuous. The VB3 series are used with the smaller channels on the
PDP to power circuits drawing current of 30A or less continuous. For
more information, see the Datasheeets for the `MX5
series <http://www.snapaction.net/pdf/MX5%20Spec%20Sheet.pdf>`__ and
