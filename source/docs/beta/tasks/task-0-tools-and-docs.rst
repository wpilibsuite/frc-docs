Task 0: Beta Test Tools and Documentation Familiarization
=========================================================

Task: Learn about the tools and documentation sources for the FRC\ |reg| Beta

Beta Test Tools
---------------

The FRC Control System Beta Test will primarily be administered through a GitHub project. Even if you are familiar with the GitHub platform, please take some time to read through the following articles to learn about how we are using the project:

- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/accessing-the-beta-project:Accessing the Beta Project`
- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/reporting-progress:Reporting Progress`
- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/trackers-reporting-bugs:Issues - Reporting Bugs`
- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/monitoring-via-email-notifications:Monitoring Via Email Notifications`

Beta Test Documentation
-----------------------

There will be 2 primary sources of Beta Test specific documentation. The first source is this manual which will primarily contain things like task instructions as well as documentation updated for the new season. This documentation is publicly accessible without a username or password.

The other source of documentation will be the Wiki section of the GitHub project. For more information on how to access that, see :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/accessing-the-beta-project:Accessing the Beta Project`. This document will any information intended to be limited to only beta teams. There may or may not be any documentation in this section.

Please read through the documentation in this section to understand the tasks associated with the Beta Test.

Run your robot with 2023 software and note the Free RAM on the DS diagnostics tab (for later comparison in task 3).
