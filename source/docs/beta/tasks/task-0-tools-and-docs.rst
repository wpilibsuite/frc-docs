- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/reporting-progress:Reporting Progress`
- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/trackers-reporting-bugs:Issues - Reporting Bugs`
- :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/monitoring-via-email-notifications:Monitoring Via Email Notifications`

Beta Test Documentation
-----------------------

There will be 2 primary sources of Beta Test specific documentation. The first source is this manual which will primarily contain things like task instructions as well as documentation updated for the new season. This documentation is publicly accessible without a username or password.

The other source of documentation will be the Wiki section of the GitHub project. For more information on how to access that, see :ref:`docs/beta/beta-getting-started/accessing-the-beta-project:Accessing the Beta Project`.
