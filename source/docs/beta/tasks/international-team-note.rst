International Team Note
=======================

A number of our international teams may have access to computers with foreign language Operating Systems installed (Spanish, French, Hebrew, etc.) This note describes some additional feedback that would be helpful to us if you have access to such a machine to use as part of your Beta test effort.

Tasks
-----

If you have access to a computer with a foreign language version of Windows, it would be helpful to our Beta Test effort to utilize that machine as part of your Beta testing. Specifically, try testing each of the unique software aspects (installation, imaging the roboRIO, running the DS, creating projects, building and downloading code, debugging code, programming a radio, etc.).

Feedback
---------

In your task reports for the appropriate tasks please indicate that you completed the task with a machine with a foreign language OS.
