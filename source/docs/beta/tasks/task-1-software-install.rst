Task 1: Software Installation
=============================

Task: Choose, acquire, and install the software required for developing FRC software in the language you have been assigned (C++, Java or LabVIEW).

Overview
--------

The FRC Control System can be programmed in LabVIEW, Java or C/C++. Teams should use the language they have been assigned for the Beta test.

Documentation for installation can be found on the :ref:`docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index:Step 2: Installing Software` page.

.. note:: For the 2021 FRC season, LabVIEW will be remaining at the same version used in the 2020 FRC season. Teams do not need to un-install or re-install the base LabVIEW installation (you will still need to install updated Game Tools). There will be re-licensing instructions coming later that we may ask teams to test.

.. note:: For this task, there is supplemental documentation provided in TeamForge for all languages. See the Documents and File Releases sections on TeamForge.
