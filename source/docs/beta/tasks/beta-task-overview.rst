Beta Task Overview
==================

This document provides an overview of the Tasks we'd like you to try for the Control System Beta Test. Further details on each Task can be found in the subsequent pages of this section. Target completion dates are provided to give you an estimate of how you may want to progress through the tasks during the test period.

.. note:: For the 2022 FRC\ |reg| Beta Test, some of you may not have access to physical robot hardware. We recognize this will inhibit your ability to complete some tasks. Teams without hardware should skip Task 2, merely ensure they can build their 2020/21 robot code for Task 3 and focus on Task 4, testing new features to the extent possible using simulation.

Task 0 - Background and Preparation
-----------------------------------

The purpose of Task 0 is to complete some housekeeping tasks and familiarize yourself with the tools and documentation for the Beta Test before beginning. This task consists of 1 Objective:

1. Beta Test Tools and Documentation Familiarization


Task 1 - Install Software (Targeted Completion 10/22/2021)
----------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of Task 1 is to complete installation of the new Control System software. This task consists of 1 Objective

1. Install the necessary software for your assigned Beta Test language (LabVIEW or VSCode + plugins, NI FRC Game Tools, CTRE installer if using CANTalon SRX, REV installer if using SPARK MAX or new REV hardware)

Task 2 - Basic Benchtop Test (Targeted Completion 10/29/2021)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of Task 2 is to get the base new Control System software set up and running. This helps minimize complexity to ease debugging of any issues that do occur. In this task you will set up the development environment for your programming language, configure the roboRIO, load and debug a simple program. This Task consists of 2 Objectives:

1. Configure the roboRIO
2. Create, Build and Load Default Program

Task 3 - Port Previous Robot Code (Targeted Completion 11/12/2021)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of Task 3 is to port the previous year's robot code with the new Control System software and bring it to full functionality. This Task consists of 2 Objectives and 1 Optional Objective:

1. Port Existing Robot Code to new System
2. Wireless Operation of FRC Robot
3. (Optional) Play with robot at offseason event

Task 4 - New Code and Advanced Feature Testing (Targeted Completion 12/3/2021)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Objectives in Task 4 may be completed in any order.

The purpose of Task 4 is to write new code in order to test features and functionality of the new Control System software. While we have written up a number of ideas, please feel free to come up with your own and report on what you tried/are trying and how it went.

1. REV Robotics Hardware and associated software
2. RoboRIO 2.0, especially the SD card imaging process
