.. image:: images/reporting-progress/task-reports.png
   :alt: The task reports section has a topic for each task.

In the Task Reports section, click the "New Discussion" button to create a single discussion topic titled `Team XXXX Task Reports` for your team and post reports for all tasks into that thread. Each task will have suggested feedback listed in the :ref:`task documents <docs/beta/tasks/beta-task-overview:Beta Task Overview>`. Additional tasks can be posted to the same thread using the editing box at the bottom of the thread.

.. note:: We strongly prefer reports be done as text posts as opposed to attachments.
