The project homepage contains a README file. Throughout the beta, the README section may be updated with the latest information from the *FIRST* technical staff, WPILib, and vendors. The top ribbon contains tabs allowing you to navigate to the different sections of the project:

1. Code - The Code tab will take you to the README with Beta announcements as well as allow you to access file releases using the "Releases" section on the right hand side of the screen.
2. Issues - The Issues tab is where the bug tracker for the project is located.
3. Discussions - The Discussions tab contains a forum which allows teams to post questions or discussions about the Beta test, software or documentation. Task reports should also be posted here.

To create your team's task report, make issue reports, or interact with discussions, you'll need to sign in to GitHub.
Near the top right corner of the page, click "Sign in", or "Sign up" if you don't already have an account, and follow the directions.
