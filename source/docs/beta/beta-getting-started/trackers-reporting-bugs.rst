Issues - Reporting Bugs
=========================

.. warning:: While we will certainly accept and respond to all bugs posted in this project, we would prefer bugs for WPILib C++/Java components (libraries, VS Code, Shuffleboard, etc.) be submitted to the appropriate `wpilibsuite GitHub repositories <https://github.com/wpilibsuite>`__. Issues that belong in one of those projects will be moved from the Beta Project to the appropriate repository.

GitHub Issue Tracker
