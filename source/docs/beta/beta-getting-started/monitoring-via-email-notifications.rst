Monitoring Via Email Notifications
==================================

.. note::
   You may wish to monitor specific items or even whole sections of the Beta project via email. TeamForge has a large degree of flexibility in setting up e-mail monitoring.

You can choose to monitor a number of different individual items (forum threads, tracker artifacts, file releases, etc.) via e-mail. Items that can be subscribed to will have a Monitor button located at the bottom of the screen. Clicking this button will subscribe you to the item and notify you of changes via e-mail. To unsubscribe, click the Stop Monitoring button (which will replace the Monitor button when you are subscribed).

Monitoring Folders
