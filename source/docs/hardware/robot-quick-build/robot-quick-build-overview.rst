Robot Quick Build Overview
==========================

The instructions used for a Robot Quick Build event can also be seen as sort of a "Quick start" guide to building your robot even if you did not attend one of these sessions.

Required Materials
------------------

-  **Tools:** The AM14U chassis documentation has a list of tools necessary for mechanical assembly. For electrical wiring  and board installation you will need:

   -  Wago Tool or other medium flat-head screwdriver
   -  Very small flat-head screwdriver and Philips head screwdriver
   -  5mm Hex key (3/16” may work if metric is unavailable, but use carefully) and a 1/16” hex key
   -  Wire cutters, strippers, and crimpers
   -  7/16” box end wrench or nut driver
   -  6 AWG wire crimper or vise to crimp compression lugs for the battery, PDP and 120A breaker.
   -  USB A male to USB B male cable for imaging and programming the roboRIO
   -  Tool to cut 1/4"- 1/2" plywood board to appropriate size
   -  Drill with 3/16” drill bit and Philips head bit

-  **Materials:** In addition to what is contained in the KoP, you will need:

   -  1/4” – 1/2” Plywood control board (for exact sizes, see :ref:`docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/how-to-wire-a-robot:How to wire an FRC Robot`
   -  Pan Philips Head Machine Screws with nuts for electrical board attachment. Note: The AM14U kit may have a small number of extra

      -  Option 1 requires (8) 10-32 x 1in and (4) 10-32 x 1.5in
      -  Option 2 requires (4) 10-32 x 1in

Basic Steps
-----------

The basic steps to get a running robot using the Robot Quick Build style are:

-  Assemble AM14U chassis (this can be done in parallel with wiring below)
-  Cut electronics Board
-  Wire electronics board according to :ref:`docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/how-to-wire-a-robot:How to wire an FRC Robot` until you reach the red text telling you to stop (after installing Circuit Breakers)
-  Install Electronics Board on Robot
-  Finish Wiring

Quick Build complete!
---------------------
Proceed to :ref:`docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/intro:Introduction` (skip wiring) to get your Control System up and running to program your robot.
