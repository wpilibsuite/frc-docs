Equipment Needed:

- Triangle part #4050 Two Bolt Flange Mounting
- Triangle Part #1508P Sintered Iron Bearing - 1/2" Bore
- Two - 1/4 - 2- bolts
- Small or adjustable wrench
- A plug gauge or something similar that is smaller than the bearing's bore
- 1/2" shaft
- gloves

**Step 1:** Put on your gloves and grab the two bolt flange mount, bearing and plug gauge.

**Step 2:** Place the Bearing sideways into the mount so it isn't completely flat.

**Step 3:** Put the plug gauge (or other tool you are using) into the bore of the bearing.

**Step 4:** Place your right hand on the bottom of the mount and put your left hand on the top of the mount.

**Step 5:** While keeping your hands in this position, push opposite sides until the bearing is fully in the mount and aligned.

**Step 6:** When the two bolt flange is fully assembled into the mount, place it on the mounting area of your product. Make sure your mounting holes are 1.75" apart.

**Step 7:** Fasten your two bolts into each mounting hole and tighten them with your wrench. Tighten with your wrench until the flange is completely secured onto your product.

**Step 8:** Place a 1/2" shaft into the bore of the bearing. Ensure the shaft can move axially.
