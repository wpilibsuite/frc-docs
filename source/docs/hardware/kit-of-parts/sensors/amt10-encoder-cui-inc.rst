What Is It?
-----------

An encoder is a sensor and an essential part of the motion control feedback loop. The encoder can be used to provide precise position, rotation and speed feedback information for your robot. It can be used to measure the rate and count of rotations, how fast a shaft on your robot is turning (RPM), as well as how far something connected to the rotary shaft has traveled.

Teams have used these encoders in the past on the wheels of the robot to monitor speed, precisely control wheel movement and to count wheel rotations. Additionally, the encoders have been used on lifting mechanisms to control lifting speed as well as measure the lift height.

The AMT10 encoders, donated by CUI Inc utilize capacitive technology to measure rotary motion. Using the DIP switch on the back of the encoder, these encoders can be quickly and easily set to any one of 16 different resolutions, allowing for maximum versatility within your robot design. Additionally, the encoder has an index pulse (Z), occurring once per rotation. This index pulse is ideally suited for determining motor or shaft RPM.

CUI’s AMT10 encoders were made available through FIRST Choice and additional AMT parts/accessories are readily available through Digi-Key Electronics at www.digikey.com.
