Debugging Network-Related Problems
==================================

Usual Symptoms
--------------

Setting up the driver station in the short few seconds before the match should be utilized to do a quick connectivity and joystick check. Assuming your robot is turned on and has been turned on for ~30-60 seconds, you might realize a problem has happened. Below are a list of common reasons you are unable to connect to your robot.

- Disconnected ethernet connection on the driver station
  - Is the ethernet port on the driver station functional?
- Disconnected ethernet connection on the robot
  - Perhaps the rio <-> radio connection came unplugged
  - Perhaps the ethernet cord is bad (can be identified by looking at the light indicators on the Rio/Radio for network activity)
- Is the firewall disabled?
  - It is recommended that the firewall is always disabled when at an events

.. todo:: add more and maybe some images

If on the field, you should immediately notify the FTA that there is a connectivity issue for the quickest resolution.

.. important:: While rare, it has been shown that the robot radio can sometimes take a large amount of time to boot - 90 seconds or more.
