Manually Setting the Driver Station to Start Custom Dashboard
=============================================================

.. note:: If WPILib is not installed to the default location (such as when files are copied to a PC manually), the dashboard of choice may not launch properly. To have the DS start a custom dashboard when it starts up, you have to manually modify the settings for the default dashboard.

.. warning:: This is not needed for most installations, try using the appropriate :ref:`Dashboard Type setting <docs/software/driverstation/driver-station:Setup Tab>` for your language first.

Set Driver Station to Default
-----------------------------

LabVIEW Custom Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replace the string after ``=`` with ``"C:\\PATH\\TO\\DASHBOARD.exe"`` where the path specified is the path to the dashboard ``exe`` file. Save the ``FRC DS Data Storage`` file.

Java Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replace the string after ``=`` with ``java -jar "C:\\PATH\\TO\\DASHBOARD.jar"`` where the path specified is the path to the dashboard ``jar`` file. Save the ``FRC DS Data Storage`` file.

.. tip:: Shuffleboard and Smartdashboard require Java 11.

Dashboard from WPILib installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replace the string after ``=`` with ``wscript "C:\\Users\\Public\\wpilib\\YYYY\\tools\\DASHBOARD.vbs"`` where ``YYYY`` is the year and ``DASHBOARD.vbs`` is either ``Shuffleboard.vbs`` or ``Smartdashboard.vbs``. Save the ``FRC DS Data Storage`` file.

Launch Driver Station
---------------------

The Driver Station should now launch the dashboard each time it is opened.
