roboRIO Introduction
====================

The roboRIO is designed specifically with FIRST in mind. The roboRIO uses the same basic architecture of a Real-Time processors + FPGA as the previous cRIO but is more powerful, lighter, and smaller.

Before deploying programs to your roboRIO, you must first image the roboRIO with the FRC roboRIO Imaging Tool.
