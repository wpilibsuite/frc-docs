# PathWeaver

.. note:: Users may find [Choreo](https://sleipnirgroup.github.io/Choreo/) or [PathPlanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner) more useful. They both have an intuitive user interface and swerve support. Users should already have access to Choreo as it is distributed with the WPILib installer.
