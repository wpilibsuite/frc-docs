.. note:: Users may find a community driven project `PathPlanner <https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner>`__ as potentially more useful. PathPlanner improves upon traditional pathplanning applications with an intuitive user interface and swerve path following support. Note that WPILib offers no support for community projects.
