Path Planning
=============

Path Planning is the process of creating and following trajectories. These paths use the WPILib trajectory APIs for generation and a :ref:`Ramsete Controller <docs/software/advanced-controls/trajectories/ramsete:Ramsete Controller>` for following. This section highlights the process of characterizing your robot for system identification, trajectory following and usage of PathWeaver. Users may also want to read the :ref:`generic trajectory following documents <docs/software/advanced-controls/trajectories/index:Trajectory Generation and Following with WPILib>` for additional information about the API and non-commandbased usage.
