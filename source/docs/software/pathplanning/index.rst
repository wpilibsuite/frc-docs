Path Planning
=============

 "Path Planning is the process of creating and following paths that your robot can autonomously follow. These paths use the WPILib trajectory APIs for generation and a :ref:`Ramsete Controller <docs/software/advanced-controls/trajectories/ramsete:Ramsete Controller>` for following. This section highlights the process of characterizing your robot for system identification, developing with the trajectory tracking API and visualizing your paths with PathWeaver. Users may also want to read the :ref:`generic trajectory following documents <docs/software/advanced-controls/trajectories/index:Trajectory Generation and Following with WPILib>` for non-commandbased usage.
