# Trajectory Tutorial

.. warning:: RamseteCommand has been deprecated and removed. Teams should use `PathPlanner <https://pathplanner.dev/>`__ or `Choreo <https://choreo.autos/>`__ for autonomous path planning.

This tutorial covers the **WPILib setup prerequisites** needed before using modern path planning tools. It will guide you through:

1. Characterizing your drivetrain with SysId
2. Setting up pose estimation with odometry
3. Creating a drive subsystem compatible with path planning libraries

After completing this tutorial, refer to the documentation for your chosen path planning tool to implement autonomous routines.
