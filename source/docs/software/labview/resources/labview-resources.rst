.. note:: To learn more about programming in LabVIEW and specifically programming FRC robots in LabVIEW, check out the following resources.

LabVIEW Basics
--------------

National Instruments provides a `combination of videos <https://www.ni.com/academic/students/learn-labview/>`_ and `traditional text/picture tutorials on the basics of LabVIEW <https://www.ni.com/getting-started/labview-basics/>`_. These tutorials can help you get acquainted with the LabVIEW environment and the basics of the graphical, dataflow programing model used in LabVIEW.

NI FRC Tutorials
----------------

National Instruments also hosts many `FRC specific tutorials and presentations ranging from basic to advanced <https://forums.ni.com/t5/FIRST-Robotics-Competition/Archived-2015-FRC-LabVIEW-Additional-Resources/ta-p/3528790?profile.language=en>`_. For an in-depth single resource check out the FRC Basic and Advanced Training Classes linked near the bottom of the page.

Installed Tutorials and Examples
--------------------------------

There are also tutorials and examples for all sorts of tasks and components provided as part of your LabVIEW installation. To access the tutorials, from the LabVIEW Splash screen (the screen that appears when the program is first launched) click on the ``Tutorials`` tab on the left side. Note that the tutorials are all in one document, so once it is open you are free to browse to other tutorials without returning to the splash screen.

To access the examples either click the ``Support`` tab, then ``Find FRC Examples`` or anytime you're working on a program open the ``Help`` menu, select ``Find Examples`` and open the ``FRC Robotics`` folder.
