   call stack
      A specially-organized region of memory which helps the program keep track of what function it is in. As each function calls another, the call point is recorded and added to the top of the structure, forming a "stack" of references. Additionally, local variables will also be stored in this stack. See [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) on Wikipedia for more info.

   moment of inertia
      The property of an object that describes both how much mass it has, and how that mass is distributed relative to a certain axis of rotation. Objects with higher moments of inertia resist changes in rotational motion more than objects with lower moments of inertia. Increasing the moment of inertia is accomplished by adding more mass, or moving the mass further away from the axis of rotation.

   permanent-magnet DC motor
      The classification of all legal motors for the FIRST robotics competition. This type of motor takes direct current as input, and uses it to create a magnetic field. In turn, this magnetic field interacts with a physical magnet to create a force that turns the output shaft. Electrical ("brushless") or mechanical ("brushed") means are used to ensure the electrically-generated magnetic field always points in a direction that creates forces when it interacts with the physical magnet, even as the motor's shaft rotates. See [permanent-magnet motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_DC_electric_motor#Permanent-magnet_motors) on Wikipedia for more info.

   PoE
      Power Over Ethernet - method of powering a device by an Ethernet cord that also carries power.  FRC uses passive PoE usually 12-24V that is always being supplied, this can damage a device not expecting the provided voltage.  The most common industry standard is active PoE which uses 48V but first verifies that the device is expecting the power.

   property
      In :term:`NetworkTables`, named information (metadata) about a :term:`topic` stored and updated separately from the topic's data. A topic may have any number of properties. A property's value can be any data type that can be represented in JSON.

   retro-reflection
      The property of reflecting incoming light back at the same angle it came in at, rather than an incident angle (like a mirror), absorbing it, or scattering it. Most FRC vision processing targets are retro-reflective. See [retroreflector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector) on Wikipedia for more information.
