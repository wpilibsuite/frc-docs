   call stack
      A specially-organized region of memory which helps the program keep track of what function it is in. As each function calls another, the call point is recorded and added to the top of the structure, forming a "stack" of references. Additionally, local variables will also be stored in this stack. See `call stack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   permanent-magnet DC motor
      The classification of all legal motors for the FIRST robotics competition. This type of motor takes direct current as input, and uses it to create a magnetic field. In turn, this magnetic field interacts with a physical magnet to create a force that turns the output shaft. Electrical ("brushless") or mechanical ("brushed") means are used to ensure the electrically-generated magnetic field always points in a direction that creates forces when it interacts with the physical magnet, even as the motor's shaft rotates.
