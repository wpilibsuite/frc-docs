The Limelight SystemCore is designed specifically with FIRST in mind. The Systemcore is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5) with a quad-core ARM real-time Cortex‑A76 processor, and uses a Raspberry Pi RP2350 for reconfigurable I/O.

The SystemCore is a reconfigurable robotics controller that includes built-in ports for Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate (CAN-FD), Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) using a STEMMA-style connector, USB, Ethernet, and 6 reconfigurable I/O ports.
The 6 I/O pins support Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Digital I/O, and Analog Inputs to quickly connect the common sensors and actuators used in robotics.

The SystemCore comes shipped with 4 GB of RAM and 16 GB of EMMC storage, and also comes with a M.2 A+E key 2230 slot for connecting compatible peripherals over a PCIe 2.0 connection.

The SystemCore also comes with integrated 2.4 and 5 GHz WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0 with BLE, but that may or may not be used for FRC purposes.

Detailed information on the SystemCore can be found in the [SystemCore technical specifications](https://downloads.limelightvision.io/documents/systemcore_specifications_june15_2025_alpha.pdf).
