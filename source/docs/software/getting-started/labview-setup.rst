Installing LabVIEW for FRC 2019 (LabVIEW only)
==============================================

.. image:: images/labview/ni_logo.png

.. note:: This installation is for teams programming in LabVIEW or using NI Vision Assistant only. C++ and Java teams not using these features do not need to install from the DVD. 
    
    Download and installation times will vary widely with computer and internet connection specifications, however note that this process involves a large file download and installation and will likely take at least an hour to complete.

Uninstall Old Vesions (recommended)
-----------------------------------

.. note:: NOTE: If you wish to keep programming cRIOs you will need to maintain an install of LabVIEW for FRC 2014. The LabVIEW for FRC 2014 license has been extended. While these versions should be able to co-exist on a single computer, this is not a configuration that has been extensively tested.

Before installing the new version of LabVIEW it is recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely co-exist with the old version, but all testing has been done with FRC 2019 only. Make sure to back up any team code located in the "User\\LabVIEW Data" directory before un-installing. Then click Start >> Control Panel >> Uninstall a Program. Locate the entry labeled "National Instruments Software", right-click on it and select Uninstall/Change.

Wait for the uninstaller to complete and reboot if prompted.
