or updated, otherwise this step will be skipped. The FRC Driver
Station and FRC Utilities will always be installed or updated. The
LabVIEW runtime components required for the driver station and
utilities is included in this package. **No components from the
LabVIEW Merged Suite are required for running either the Driver
Station or Utilities.**

 Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. It will not work on Windows XP.

Uninstall Old Versions (Recommended)
------------------------------------

**LabVIEW teams have already completed this step, do not
repeat it.** Before installing the new version of the NI Update it is
recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely

FRC 2019 only. Make sure to back up any team code located in the
``User:\LabVIEW\Data`` directory before un-installing. Then
click **Start >> Control Panel >> Uninstall a Program.** Locate the
entry labeled “**National Instruments Software**”, right-click on it and
select **Uninstall/Change**.
