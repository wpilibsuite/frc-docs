Generating Code for a Project
=============================

.. important:: RobotBuilder has been updated to support the new commandbased framework! Unfortunately, this documentation is outdated and only for the old commandbased framework. Individuals interested in updating this documentation can open a pull request on the `frc-docs <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/frc-docs>`__ repository.

.. note:: After you've set up your robot framework in RobotBuilder, you'll need to export the code and load it into Visual Studio Code. This article describes the process for doing so.

Generate the Code for the Project
---------------------------------
