To edit a property value, say, Background color, click the background color shown (in this case grey), and choose a color from the color editor that pops up. This will be used as the widgets background color.

Different widget types have different sets of editable properties to change the appearance. In this example, the upper and lower limits of the dial and the tick interval are changeable parameters.
