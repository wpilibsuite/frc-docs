Glass
=====
Glass is a new dashboard and robot data visualization tool. Its GUI is extremely similar to that of the :ref:`Simulation GUI <docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/simulation-gui:Simulation User Interface>`. In its current state, it is meant to be used as a programmer's tool rather than a proper dashboard in a competition environment.

.. note:: Glass will not be available within the list of dashboards in the NI Driver Station for 2021.
