The Field2d Widget
==================
Glass supports displaying your robot's position on the field using the :guilabel:`Field2d` widget. An instance of the ``Field2d`` class should be created, sent over NetworkTables, and updated periodically with the latest robot pose in your robot code.

Sending Robot Pose from User Code
---------------------------------
To send your robot's position (usually obtained by :ref:`odometry <docs/software/kinematics-and-odometry/intro-and-chassis-speeds:What is odometry?>` or a pose estimator), a ``Field2d`` instance must be created in robot code and sent over NetworkTables. The instance must then be updated periodically with the latest robot pose.

.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: java

      private Field2d m_field;

      public Drivetrain() {
        ...
        SmartDashboard.putData("Field", m_field);
      }

      ...

      public void periodic() {
        ...
        m_field.setRobotPose(m_odometry.getPoseMeters());
      }

   .. code-tab:: c++

      #include <frc/smartdashboard/Field2d.h>
      #include <frc/smartdashboard/SmartDashboard.h>

      frc::Field2d m_field;

      Drivetrain() {
        ...
        frc::SmartDashboard::PutData("Field", &m_field);
      }

      ...

      void Periodic() {
        ...
        m_field.SetRobotPose(m_odometry.GetPose());
      }

.. note:: The ``Field2d`` instance can also be sent using a lower-level NetworkTables API or using the :ref:`Shuffleboard API <docs/software/wpilib-tools/shuffleboard/getting-started/shuffleboard-displaying-data:Displaying data from your robot>`. In this case, the ``SmartDashboard`` API was used, meaning that the :guilabel:`Field2d` widget will appear under the ``SmartDashboard`` table name.

Viewing the Robot Pose in Glass
-------------------------------
After sending the ``Field2d`` instance over NetworkTables, the :guilabel:`Field2d` widget can be added to Glass by selecting :guilabel:`NetworkTables` in the menu bar, choosing the table name that the instance was sent over, and then clicking on the :guilabel:`Field` button.

Once the widget appears, you can resize and place it on the Glass workspace as you desire. Right-clicking the top of the widget will allow you to customize the name of the widget, select a custom field image, select a custom robot image, and choose the dimensions of the field and robot.

.. note:: You can retrieve the latest field image from `here <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/PathWeaver/tree/master/src/main/resources/edu/wpi/first/pathweaver>`__. This is the same image that is used when generating paths using :ref:`PathWeaver <docs/software/wpilib-tools/pathweaver/introduction:Introduction to PathWeaver>`.
