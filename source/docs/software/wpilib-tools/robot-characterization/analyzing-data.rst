Analyzing Data
==============

Once we have data from a characterization run, we can analyze it. To launch the data analyzer, click on the ``Launch Data Analyzer`` button.

Loading your Data File
----------------------

Now it's time to load the data file we saved from the logger tool. Click on ``Select Data File``.

In the resulting file dialog, select the JSON file you want to analyze. If the file appears to be malformed, an error will be shown.

Running Feedforward Analysis
----------------------------

Once a data file has been selected, the ``Analyze Data`` button becomes available in the ``Feedforward Analysis`` frame. Click it.

By default, the analysis will be run by combining all the data in the test. For a finer-grained analysis, the analysis may be limited to a specific subset of data using the subset dropdown menu.

The computed coefficients of the mechanism characterization will then be filled in, along with a goodness-of-fit measure (r-squared).
