Known Issues
============

This article details known issues (and workarounds) for FRC Control System Software.

Visual Studio Code Fails to Launch Offline
------------------------------------------

There are reports that on some builds of Windows 10 (build 1809), VS Code may fail to launch if no network is present (note: this is different than no internet present).

**Workaround:** Install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter

1. Access the Device Manager (typically by clicking start and typing Device Manager)
2. Click the Network Adapter Category
3. Click the Action menu from the top bar and select Add Legacy Hardware
4. Click Next on the window that pops up
5. Select the second option to install manually
6. Select “Network Adapter” and click Next. You will need to wait a bit for the next screen to populate.
7. Select Microsoft in the Manufacturer pane, then Microsoft Loopback Adapter in the right pane.
8. Click Next twice to install the adapter, then Finish to close the window.

C++ Intellisense - Files Open on Launch Don't Work Properly
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Issue:** In C++, files open when VS Code launches will have issues with Intellisense showing suggestions from all options from a compilation unit and not just the appropriate ones. This is a bug in VS Code

**Workaround:** Close the files in VS Code, close VS Code, wait ~ 1 min, re-launch VS Code.

SmartDashboard and Simulation fail to launch on Windows N Editions
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Issue:** WPILib code using CSCore (dashboards and simulated robot code) will fail to launch on Education N editions of Windows.

**Solution:** Install the `Media Feature Pack <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack>`__

PathWeaver Tank Drive Swapped Paths
-----------------------------------

There is currently an issue with PathWeaver where the left and right sides of the drivetrain are swapped. This can be solved quickly with the instructions in the article, :ref:`Intergrating Path Following into a Robot Program <docs/software/wpilib-tools/path-planning/pathfinder/integrating-robot-program:Integrating path following into a robot program>`. This will be fixed in the next update.

NetworkTables Interoperability
------------------------------

There is currently an issue with inter-operating C++/Java Network Tables clients (dashboards or co-processors) with LabVIEW servers (LV robot code). In some scenarios users will see updates from one client fail to be replicated across to other clients (e.g. data from a co-processor will not be properly replicated out to a dashboard). Data still continues to return correctly when accessed by code on the server.

**Workaround**: Write code on the server to mirror any keys you wish to see on other clients (e.g. dashboards) to a separate key. For example, if you have a key named ``targetX`` being published by a co-processor that you want to show up on a dashboard, you could write code on the robot to read the key and re-write it to a key like ``targetXDash``.
