Thresholding an Image
=====================

In order to turn a colored image, such as the one captured by your camera, into a binary image, with the target as the "foreground", we need to threshold the image using the hue, saturation, and value of each pixel.



HSV Model
_________

Unlike RGB, HSV allows us to not only filter based on the colors of the pixels, but also by the intensity of color and the brightness.

* Hue: Measures the color of the pixel.
* Saturation: Measures the intensity of color of the pixel.
* Value: Measures the brighness of the pixel.

You can use OpenCV to convert a BGR image matrix to HSV.

      hsv_img = cv2.cvtColor(input_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

.. note::
   OpenCV's hue range is from 1째 to 180째 instead of the common 1째 to 360째. In order to convert a common hue value to OpenCV, divide by 2. 

Thresholding
____________

By thresholding the image, we can seperate the image into the vision target (foreground), and the other things that the camera sees (background). 

* Hue: Most FRC Vision systems should have a green LED setup, so in this example we will only include pixels in the green hue range in the foreground.
* Saturation: Because the retroreflector tape should reflect the most color back to the camera, in this example we will only include pixels above a certain saturation.
* Value: Your camera exposure should be low, which would "dim down" the image overall, so in this example we will only include pixels above a certain brightness.
