Importing a Gradle Project
==========================

Due to changes in the project, it is necessary to update the build files for a previous years Gradle project. It is also necessary to import vendor libraries again, since last year's vendor libraries must be updated to be compatible with this year's projects.

Automatic Import
----------------

To make it easy for teams to import previous years gradle projects into the current year's framework, WPILib includes a wizard for importing previous years projects into VS Code. This will generate the necessary gradle components and load the project into VS Code. In place upgrades are not supported. The importer automatically imports the old or new command framework 3rd party library (which ever one was used on the imported project).

.. important:: The import process copies your project source files from the current directory to a new directory and completely regenerates the gradle files. If you made non-standard updates to the build.gradle, you will need to make those changes again. For this reason, in place upgrades are not supported. It is also necessary to import vendor libraries again, since last year's vendor libraries must be updated to be compatible with this year's projects.

Launching the Import Wizard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/importing-previous-project/ImportPopup.png

When you open a previous year's project, you will be prompted to import that project. Click :guilabel:`yes`.

Alternately, you can chose to import it from the menu. Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "WPILib" or click the WPILib icon to locate the WPILib commands. Begin typing "Import a WPILib 2020 Gradle project" and select it from the dropdown as shown below.

.. image:: images/importing-previous-project/VSCodeImport.png

You'll be presented with the WPILib Project Importer window. This is similar to the process of creating a new project and the window and the steps are shown below.  This window contains the following elements:

1. **Gradle Project**: Selects the project to be imported.  Users should select the build.gradle file in the root directory of the gradle project.
2. **Project Location**: This determines the folder in which the robot project will be located.
3. **Project Name**: The name of the robot project.  This also specifies the name that the project folder will be given if the Create New Folder box is checked. This must be a different directory from the original location.
4. **Create a New Folder**: If this is checked, a new folder will be created to hold the project within the previously-specified folder.  If it is *not* checked, the project will be located directly in the previously-specified folder.  An error will be thrown if the folder is not empty and this is not checked.
5. **Team Number**: The team number for the project, which will be used for package names within the project and to locate the robot when deploying code.
6. **Enable Desktop Support**: If this is checked, simulation and unit test support is enabled. However, there are some cases where this will do some unexpected things. In addition, all vendor libraries need desktop support which not all libraries do.

Click :guilabel:`Import Project` to begin the upgrade.

The gradle project will be upgraded and copied into the new project directory. You can then either open the new project immediately (the pop-up shown below should appear in the bottom right) or open it later using the :kbd:`Ctrl+O` (or :kbd:`Command+O` for macOS) shortcut.

C++ Configurations (C++ Only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For C++ projects, there is one more step to set up IntelliSense. Whenever you open a project, you should get a pop-up in the bottom right corner asking to refresh C++ configurations.  Click :guilabel:`Yes` to set up IntelliSense.

3rd Party Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is necessary to update and re-import 3rd party libraries. See :doc:`3rd Party Libraries <3rd-party-libraries>` for details.

Manual Import Process (2020 to 2021)
------------------------------------

As there were minimal changes to the gradle templates in 2021, it is possible to manually import a project from a 2020 version of GradleRIO to 2021, which may be convenient if you've heavily customized your build.gradle file. This method does *not* work for importing a 2019 project, and will not work for future years. There are two files that need to be updated.

wpilib_preferences.json
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open ``.wpilib\wpilib_preferences.json`` and change the ``projectYear`` to ``2021``.

             }
         }

1. Change the GradleRIO version to the latest version (e.g. 2021.1.1 for the kickoff release)
2. (C++ Only) move ``wpi.deps.vendor.cpp(it)`` above ``wpi.deps.wpilib(it)`` (2 places)
3. (Optional) add ``simulation wpi.deps.sim.driverstation(wpi.platforms.desktop, XXXX)`` where XXXX is false for Java and true for C++. This allows the driver station to be used in simulation
4. (Optional) add the websocket and simulation configuration blocks to support websockets simulation (i.e. Romi)

Update 3rd Party Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is necessary to update 3rd party libraries. See :doc:`3rd Party Libraries <3rd-party-libraries>` for details.
