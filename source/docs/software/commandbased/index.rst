Command-Based Programming
=========================

.. note:: Old command-based is no longer available in 2023. Users should migrate to the new command-based framework below. Documentation for old command-based is available `here <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/2021/docs/software/old-commandbased/index.html>`_.

This sequence of articles serves as an introduction to and reference for the WPILib command-based framework.

For a collection of example projects using the command-based framework, see :ref:`docs/software/examples-tutorials/wpilib-examples:Command-Based Examples`.
