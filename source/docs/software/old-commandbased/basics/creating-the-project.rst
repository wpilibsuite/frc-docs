Creating a Robot Project
========================

.. important:: This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library, which has been deprecated. While this documentation has been preserved to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library <docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`.

Creating a project is detailed in :ref:`docs/software/wpilib-overview/creating-robot-program:Creating a Robot Program`. Select "Template" then "Command Robot" to create a basic Command-Based Robot program. Alternately you can use RobotBuilder to create the framework of your Command-Based Robot project as detailed in RobotBuilder.
