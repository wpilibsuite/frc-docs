FRC CAN Device Specifications
=============================

This document seeks to describe the basic functions of the current FRC
CAN system and the requirements for any new CAN devices seeking to work
with the system.

Addressing
----------

FRC CAN nodes assign arbitration IDs based on a pre-defined scheme that
breaks the ID into 5 components:

Device Type
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a 5-bit value describing the type of device being addressed. A
table of currently assigned device types can be found below. If you wish
to have a new device type assigned from the ``Reserved`` pool, please
submit a request to FIRST.

========================= =====

Manufacturer
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an 8-bit value indicating the manufacturer of the CAN device.
Currently assigned values can be found in the table below. If you wish
to have a manufacturer ID assigned from the ``Reserved``\ pool, please
submit a request to FIRST.

===================== ==========

===================== ==========

API/Message Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API or Message Identifier is a 10-bit value that identifies a
particular command or message type. These identifiers are unique for
each Manufacturer + Device Type combination (so an API identifier that
may be a “Voltage Set” for a Luminary Micro Motor Controller may be a
“Status Get” for a CTR Electronics Motor Controller or ``Current Get``
for a CTR Power Distribution Module).

The Message identifier is further broken down into 2 sub-fields: the
6-bit API Class and the 4-bit API Index.

API Class
~~~~~~~~~

The API Class is a 6-bit identifier for an API grouping. Similar
messages are grouped into a single API Class. An example of the API
Classes for the Jaguar Motor Controller is shown in the table below.

========================= =
API Class
========================= =
Voltage Control Mode      0
Speed Control Mode        1
Voltage Compensation Mode 2
Position Control Mode     3
Current Control Mode      4
Status                    5
Periodic Status           6
Configuration             7
Ack                       8
========================= =

API Index
~~~~~~~~~

The API Index is a 4-bit identifier for a particular message within an
API Class. An example of the API Index values for the Jaguar Motor
Controller Speed Control API Class is shown in the table below.

=========================== ==
API Index
=========================== ==
Enable Control              0
Disable Control             1
Set Setpoint                2
P Constant                  3
I Constant                  4
D Constant                  5
Set Reference               6
Trusted Enable              7
Trusted Set No Ack          8
Trusted Set Setpoint No Ack 10
Set Setpoint No Ack         11
=========================== ==

Device Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Device Number is a 6-bit quantity indicating the number of the device of
a particular type. Devices should default to device ID 0 to match other
components of the FRC Control System. Device 0x3F may be reserved for
device specific broadcast messages.

Protected Frames
----------------

FRC CAN Nodes which implement actuator control capability (motor
controllers, relays, pneumatics controllers, etc.) must implement a way
to verify that the robot is enabled and that commands originate with the
main robot controller (i.e. the roboRIO).

Broadcast Messages
------------------

Broadcast messages are messages sent to all nodes by setting the device
type and manufacturer fields to 0. The API Class for broadcast messages
is 0. The currently defined broadcast messages are shown in the table
below:

================= ==
Description
================= ==
Disable	          0
System Halt	      1
System Reset      2
Device Assign     3
Device Query	  4
Heartbeat         5
Sync              6
Update            7
Firmware Version  8
Enumerate         9
System Resume     10
================= ==

Devices should disable immediately when receiving the Disable message
(arbID 0), implementation of other broadcast messages is optional.

Requirements for FRC CAN Nodes
------------------------------
For CAN Nodes to be accepted for use in the FRC System, they must:

-  Communicate using Arbitration IDs which match the prescribed FRC
   format:

   -  A valid, issued CAN Device Type (per Table 1 - CAN Device Types)
   -  A valid, issued Manufacturer ID (per Table 2 - CAN Manufacturer Codes)
   -  API Class(es) and Index(s) assigned and documented by the device manufacturer
   -  A user selectable device number if multiple units of the device type are intended to co-exist on the same network.

-  Support the minimum Broadcast message requirements as detailed in the Broadcast Messages section.
-  If controlling actuators, utilize a scheme to assure that the robot is issuing commands, is enabled, and is still present
-  Provide software library support for LabVIEW, C++, and Java or arrange with FIRST or FIRSTs Control System Partners to provide such interfaces.
