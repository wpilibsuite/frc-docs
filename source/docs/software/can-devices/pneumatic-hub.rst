The Pneumatic Hub (PH) is a CAN-based device that provides complete control over the compressor and up to 16 solenoids per module. The PH is integrated into WPILib through a series of classes that make it simple to use.

The closed loop control of the Compressor and Pressure switch is handled by the :code:`Compressor` class (`Java <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/Compressor.html>`__, `C++ <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_compressor.html>`__), and the Solenoids are handled by the :code:`Solenoid` (`Java <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/Solenoid.html>`__, `C++ <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_solenoid.html>`__) and :code:`DoubleSolenoid` (`Java <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/DoubleSolenoid.html>`__, `C++ <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_double_solenoid.html>`__) classes.

An additional PH module can be used where the module's corresponding solenoids are differentiated by the module number in the constructors of the Solenoid and Compressor classes.
