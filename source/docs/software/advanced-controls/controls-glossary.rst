   bang-bang control
      A very simple, no-tuning-required closed-loop control technique. It simply "turns on" the :term:`control effort` when the :term:`process variable` is too small, and "turns off" the control effort when the process variable is too big. It works well in some cases, but not all. See `"Bang-bang" control <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   Cartesian coordinate system
      A set of points in space where each point is described by a set of numbers, indicating its *coordinates* within that space. These coordinates are an expression of the :term:`orthogonal` distance of each point from a set of fixed, orthogonal axes (IE, a "rectangular" system). 2-dimension and 3-dimension spaces are most common in FRC (and likely what was learned in algebra 1), but any number of dimensions is theoretically possible. See `Cartesian coordinate system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   churning losses
      Complex friction-like forces arising from the fact that when gears and bearings rotate, they must displace liquid lubricant. This reduces the efficiency of rotating mechanisms.

   control signal
      The driving signal sent to a :term:`plant` by a :term:`controller`, usually quantified as a voltage.

   control effort
      :term:`Control signal`

   control law
      A mathematical formula that generates :term:`inputs <input>` to drive a :term:`system` to a desired :term:`state`, given the current :term:`state`. A common example is the control law :math:`\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{K(r - x)}`

   controller
      Used in position or negative feedback with a :term:`plant` to bring about a desired :term:`system state <state>` by driving the difference between a :term:`reference` signal and the :term:`output` to zero.

   convolution
      A mathematical operation that calculates a weighted moving average of one function, with the weights assigned by a second function. A common way to "filter" sensor input is to apply a *convolution* to it, using a carefully-chosen filtering function. See `convolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution>`__. on Wikipedia for more info.

   counter-electromotive force
      A :term:`voltage` generated in a spinning motor. The voltage is a result of the fact that has a coil of wire rotating near a magnet. See `Counter-electromotive_force <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   current
      The flow of electrons through a conductor. Current is described with a unit of "Amps" (or simply "A"), and is measured at a single point in a circuit. One amp is equal to :math:`6241509074000000000` electrons moving past the measurement point in one second.

   dynamics
      A branch of physics concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces. In modern control, systems evolve according to their dynamics.

   derivative
      A mathematical operation which evaluates the "rate-of-change" of a function at a given point. See `derivative <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   error
      :term:`Reference <reference>` minus an :term:`output` or :term:`state`.

   exponential search
      An iterative process of finding a specific value within a wide search range by applying a multiplicative factor to the search value. See `exponential search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_search>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   exponential smoothing
      A very common way to implement a simple low-pass filter, using an exponential window function in a :term:`convolution` with an input signal. The convolution operation simplifies down to a very simple set of math operations on the current input and previous output. See `exponential smoothing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   gain
      A scalar value that relates the magnitude of an input signal to the magnitude of an output signal. For example, ``gain`` in ``output = gain * input``. A gain greater than one would amplify an input signal, while a gain less than one would dampen an input signal. A negative gain would negate the input signal.

   Gaussian distribution
      A special mathematical function that describes distributions of averages. The graph of a Gaussian function is a "bell curve" shape. This function is described by its mean (the location of the "peak" of the bell curve) and variance (a measure of how "spread out" the bell curve is). See `Gaussian distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function>`__  on Wikipedia for more info.

   gradient
      The :term:`derivative`, but applied to a function with multiple inputs. As a result, the output is both the magnitude of the rate of change, and the vector direction along which it occurs.

   hidden state
      A :term:`state` that cannot be directly measured, but whose :term:`dynamics` can be related to other states.

   input
      An input to the :term:`plant` (hence the name) that can be used to change the :term:`plant's <plant>` :term:`state`.

         - Ex. A flywheel will have 1 input: the voltage of the motor driving it.
         - Ex. A drivetrain might have 2 inputs: the voltages of the left and right motors.

      Inputs are often represented by the variable :math:`\mathbf{u}`, a column vector with one entry per :term:`input` to the :term:`system`.

   least-squares regression
      A curve-fitting technique which picks a curve to minimizes the *square* of the error between the fitted curve, and the actual measured data. See `ordinary least-squares regression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   LQR
     Linear-Quadratic Regulator - A feedback control scheme which seeks to operate a system in a "most optimal" or "lowest cost" manner, in the sense of minimizing the square of some "cost function" that represents a combination of system error and control effort. This requires an accurate mathematical model of the system being controlled, and function describing the "cost" of any given system state. See `LQR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%E2%80%93quadratic_regulator>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   measurement
      Measurements are :term:`outputs <output>` that are measured from a :term:`plant`, or physical system, using sensors.

   model
      A set of mathematical equations that reflects some aspect of a physical :term:`system's <system>` behavior.

   observer
      In control theory, a system that provides an estimate of the internal :term:`state` of a given real :term:`system` from measurements of the :term:`input` and :term:`output` of the real :term:`system`. WPILib includes a Kalman Filter class for observing linear systems, and ExtendedKalmanFilter and UnscentedKalmanFilter classes for nonlinear systems.

   orthogonal
      Having the property of being independent, or lacking mutual influence. For example, two lines are orthogonal if moving any number of units along one line causes zero displacement along the other line. In a :term:`cartesian coordinate system`, orthogonal lines are often said to have 90-degree angles between each other.

   output
      Measurements from sensors. There can be more measurements then states. These outputs are used in the "correct" step of Kalman Filters.

         - Ex. A flywheel might have 1 :term:`output` from a encoder that measures it's velocity.
         - Ex. A drivetrain might use solvePNP and V-SLAM to find it's x/y/heading position on the field. It's fine that there are 6 measurements (solvePNP x/y/heading and V-SLAM x/y/heading) and 3 states (robot x/y/heading).

      Outputs of a :term:`system` are often represented using the variable :math:`\mathbf{y}`, a column vector with one entry per :term:`output` (or thing we can measure). For example, if our :term:`system` had states for velocity and acceleration but our sensor could only measure velocity, our, our :term:`output` vector would only include the :term:`system`\'s velocity.

   phase portrait
      A graph of a function's value and its :term:`derivative` as they change in time, given some initial starting conditions. They are useful for analyzing system behavior (stable/unstable operating points, limit cycles, etc.) given a certain set of parameters or starting conditions. See `phase portrait <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_portrait>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   PID
      Proportional-Integral-Derivative - A feedback controller which calculates a :term:`control signal` from a weighted sum of the :term:`error`, the rate of change of the error, and an accumulated sum of previous errors. See `PID controller <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`__. on Wikipedia for more info.

   plant
      The :term:`system` or collection of actuators being controlled.

   process variable
      The term used to describe the output of a :term:`plant` in the context of PID control.

   r-squared

      A statistical measurement of how well a model predicts a set of data, representing the fraction of the observed variation in the independent variable that is accurately predicted by the model. The value typically runs from 0.0 (a terrible fit, equivalent to just guessing the average value of your independent variable) to 1.0 (a perfect fit). See `Coefficient_of_determination <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   reference
      The desired state. This value is used as the reference point for a controller's error calculation.

   rise time
      The time a :term:`system` takes to initially reach the :term:`reference` after applying a :term:`step input`.

   RMSE
      Root Mean Squared Error - Statistical measurement of how well a curve is fit to a set of data. It is calculated as the square root of the average (mean) of the squares of all the errors between the actual sample and the curve fit. It has units of the original input data. See `Root Mean Squared Error <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   setpoint
      The term used to describe the :term:`reference` of a PID controller.

   settling time
      The time a :term:`system` takes to settle at the :term:`reference` after a :term:`step input` is applied.

   signum function
      A non-continuous function that expresses the "sign" of its input. It is equal to -1 for all negative input numbers, 0 for an input of 0, and 1 for all positive input numbers. See `signum function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function>`__, on Wikipedia for more info.

   state
      A characteristic of a :term:`system` (e.g., velocity) that can be used to determine the :term:`system's <system>` future behavior. In state-space notation, the state of a system is written as a column vector describing it's position in state-space.

         - Ex. A drivetrain system might have the states :math:`\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ \theta \end{bmatrix}` to describe it's position on the field.
         - Ex. An elevator system might have the states :math:`\begin{bmatrix} \text{position} \\ \text{velocity} \end{bmatrix}` to describe its current height and velocity.

      A :term:`system's <system>` state is often represented by the variable :math:`\mathbf{x}`, a column vector with one entry per :term:`state`.

   statistically robust
      The property of a data processing algorithm which makes it resilient to a noisy or outlier-prone data set. Designing statistically robust algorithms on robots is important because real-world sensor data can often be unpredictable, but unexpected robot behavior is never desirable. See `Robust Statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   steady-state error
      :term:`Error <error>` after :term:`system` reaches equilibrium.

   step input
      A :term:`system` :term:`input` that is :math:`0` for :math:`t < 0` and a constant greater than :math:`0` for :math:`t \geq 0`. A step input that is :math:`1` for :math:`t \geq 0` is called a unit step input.

   step response
      The response of a :term:`system` to a :term:`step input`.

   system
      A term encompassing a :term:`plant` and it's interaction with a :term:`controller` and :term:`observer`, which is treated as a single entity. Mathematically speaking, a :term:`system` maps :term:`inputs <input>` to :term:`outputs <output>` through a linear combination of :term:`states <state>`.

   system identification
        The process of capturing a :term:`systems <system>` :term:`dynamics` in a mathematical model using measured data. The SysId toolsuite uses system identification to find kS, kV and kA terms.

   system response
      The behavior of a :term:`system` over time for a given :term:`input`.

   voltage
      The measurement of how much an electric field is "pushing" electrons through a circuit. It is sometimes called "Electromotive Force", or "EMF". It is measured in units of "Volts". It always is defined between *two* points in a circuit. If one electron travels between two points that have one volt of EMF between them, it will have been accelerated to the point of having :math:`\frac{1}{6241509074000000000}` joules of energy.

   viscous drag
      The force generated from an object moving *relatively* slowly through non-turbulent fluid. In this region, the force is roughly proportional to the *velocity* of the object. It describes the most common type of "air resistance" an FRC robot would encounter, as well as losses in a gearbox from displacing grease. See `Drag (physics) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)#Very_low_Reynolds_numbers:_Stokes'_drag>`__ on Wikipedia for more info.

   x-dot
      :math:`\dot{\mathbf{x}}`, or x-dot: the derivative of the :term:`state` vector :math:`\mathbf{x}`. If the :term:`system` had just a velocity :term:`state`, then :math:`\dot{\mathbf{x}}` would represent the :term:`system`\'s acceleration.

   x-hat
      :math:`\hat{\mathbf{x}}`, or x-hat: the estimated :term:`state` of a system, as estimated by an :term:`observer`.
