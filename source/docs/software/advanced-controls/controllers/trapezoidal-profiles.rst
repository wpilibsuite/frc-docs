# Trapezoidal Motion Profiles in WPILib

.. todo:: link to conceptual motion profiling article

.. note:: This article covers the in-code generation of trapezoidal motion profiles.  Documentation describing the involved concepts in more detail is forthcoming.

.. note:: For a guide on implementing the ``TrapezoidProfile`` class in the :ref:`command-based framework <docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based:What Is "Command-Based" Programming?>` framework, see :doc:`/docs/software/commandbased/profile-subsystems-commands`.

.. note:: The ``TrapezoidProfile`` class, used on its own, is most useful when composed with a custom controller (such as a "smart" motor controller with a built-in PID functionality).  To integrate it with a WPILib ``PIDController``, see :doc:`profiled-pidcontroller`.

While feedforward and feedback control offer convenient ways to achieve a given setpoint, we are often still faced with the problem of generating setpoints for our mechanisms.  While the naive approach of immediately commanding a mechanism to its desired state may work, it is often suboptimal.  To improve the handling of our mechanisms, we often wish to command mechanisms to a *sequence* of setpoints that smoothly interpolate between its current state, and its desired goal state.

To help users do this, WPILib provides a ``TrapezoidProfile`` class ([Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/trajectory/TrapezoidProfile.html), [C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_trapezoid_profile.html), :external:py:class:`Python <wpimath.trajectory.TrapezoidProfile>`).

## Creating a TrapezoidProfile

.. note:: In C++, the ``TrapezoidProfile`` class is templated on the unit type used for distance measurements, which may be angular or linear.  The passed-in values *must* have units consistent with the distance units, or a compile-time error will be thrown.  For more information on C++ units, see :ref:`docs/software/basic-programming/cpp-units:The C++ Units Library`.

### Constraints

.. note:: The various :ref:`feedforward helper classes <docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/feedforward:Feedforward Control in WPILib>` provide methods for calculating the maximum simultaneously-achievable velocity and acceleration of a mechanism.  These can be very useful for calculating appropriate motion constraints for your ``TrapezoidProfile``.

In order to create a trapezoidal motion profile, we must first impose some constraints on the desired motion.  Namely, we must specify a maximum velocity and acceleration that the mechanism will be expected to achieve during the motion.  To do this, we create an instance of the ``TrapezoidProfile.Constraints`` class ([Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/trajectory/TrapezoidProfile.Constraints.html), [C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_trapezoid_profile_1_1_constraints.html), :external:py:class:`Python <wpimath.trajectory.TrapezoidProfile.Constraints>`):

.. tab-set-code::

  ```java
  // Creates a new set of trapezoidal motion profile constraints
  // Max velocity of 10 meters per second
  // Max acceleration of 20 meters per second squared
  new TrapezoidProfile.Constraints(10, 20);
  ```

  ```c++
  // Creates a new set of trapezoidal motion profile constraints
  // Max velocity of 10 meters per second
  // Max acceleration of 20 meters per second squared
  frc::TrapezoidProfile<units::meters>::Constraints{10_mps, 20_mps_sq};
  ```

  ```python
  from wpimath.trajectory import TrapezoidProfile
  # Creates a new set of trapezoidal motion profile constraints
  # Max velocity of 10 meters per second
  # Max acceleration of 20 meters per second squared
  TrapezoidProfile.Constraints(10, 20)
  ```

### Start and End States

Next, we must specify the desired starting and ending states for our mechanisms using the ``TrapezoidProfile.State`` class ([Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/trajectory/TrapezoidProfile.State.html), [C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_trapezoid_profile_1_1_state.html), :external:py:class:`Python <wpimath.trajectory.TrapezoidProfile.State>`).  Each state has a position and a velocity:

.. tab-set-code::

  ```java
  // Creates a new state with a position of 5 meters
  // and a velocity of 0 meters per second
  new TrapezoidProfile.State(5, 0);
  ```

  ```c++
  // Creates a new state with a position of 5 meters
  // and a velocity of 0 meters per second
  frc::TrapezoidProfile<units::meters>::State{5_m, 0_mps};
  ```

  ```python
  from wpimath.trajectory import TrapezoidProfile
  # Creates a new state with a position of 5 meters
  # and a velocity of 0 meters per second
  TrapezoidProfile.State(5, 0)
  ```

### Putting It All Together

.. note:: C++ is often able to infer the type of the inner classes, and thus a simple initializer list (without the class name) can be sent as a parameter.  The full class names are included in the example below for clarity.

Now that we know how to create a set of constraints and the desired start/end states, we are ready to create our motion profile.  The ``TrapezoidProfile`` constructor takes 1 parameter: the constraints.

.. tab-set-code::

  ```java
  // Creates a new TrapezoidProfile
  // Profile will have a max vel of 5 meters per second
  // Profile will have a max acceleration of 10 meters per second squared
  TrapezoidProfile profile = new TrapezoidProfile(new TrapezoidProfile.Constraints(5, 10));
  ```

  ```c++
  // Creates a new TrapezoidProfile
  // Profile will have a max vel of 5 meters per second
  // Profile will have a max acceleration of 10 meters per second squared
  frc::TrapezoidProfile<units::meters> profile{
    frc::TrapezoidProfile<units::meters>::Constraints{5_mps, 10_mps_sq}};
  ```

  ```python
  from wpimath.trajectory import TrapezoidProfile
  # Creates a new TrapezoidProfile
  # Profile will have a max vel of 5 meters per second
  # Profile will have a max acceleration of 10 meters per second squared
  profile = TrapezoidProfile(TrapezoidProfile.Constraints(5, 10))
  ```

## Using a ``TrapezoidProfile``

### Sampling the Profile

Once we've created a ``TrapezoidProfile``, using it is very simple: to get the profile state at the given time after the profile has started, call the ``calculate()`` method with the goal state and initial state:

.. tab-set-code::

  ```java
  // Profile will start stationary at zero position
  // Profile will end stationary at 5 meters
  // Returns the motion profile state after 5 seconds of motion
  profile.calculate(5, new TrapezoidProfile.State(0, 0), new TrapezoidProfile.State(5, 0));
  ```

  ```c++
  // Profile will start stationary at zero position
  // Profile will end stationary at 5 meters
  // Returns the motion profile state after 5 seconds of motion
  profile.Calculate(5_s,
  frc::TrapezoidProfile<units::meters>::State{0_m, 0_mps},
  frc::TrapezoidProfile<units::meters>::State{5_m, 0_mps});
  ```

  ```python
  # Profile will start stationary at zero position
  # Profile will end stationary at 5 meters
  # Returns the motion profile state after 5 seconds of motion
  profile.calculate(5, TrapezoidProfile.State(0, 0), TrapezoidProfile.State(5, 0))
  ```

### Using the State

The ``calculate`` method returns a ``TrapezoidProfile.State`` class (the same one that was used to specify the initial/end states when calculating the profile state).  To use this for actual control, simply pass the contained position and velocity values to whatever controller you wish (for example, a PIDController):

.. tab-set-code::

  ```java
  var setpoint = profile.calculate(elapsedTime, initialState, goalState);
  controller.calculate(encoder.getDistance(), setpoint.position);
  ```

  ```c++
  auto setpoint = profile.Calculate(elapsedTime, initialState, goalState);
  controller.Calculate(encoder.GetDistance(), setpoint.position.value());
  ```

  ```python
  setpoint = profile.calculate(elapsedTime, initialState, goalState)
  controller.calculate(encoder.getDistance(), setpoint.position)
  ```

## Complete Usage Example

.. note:: In this example, the initial state is re-computed every timestep. This is a somewhat different usage technique than is detailed above, but works according to the same principles - the profile is sampled at a time corresponding to the loop period to get the setpoint for the next loop iteration.

A more complete example of ``TrapezoidProfile`` usage is provided in the ElevatorTrapezoidProfile example project ([Java](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/elevatortrapezoidprofile), [C++](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibcExamples/src/main/cpp/examples/ElevatorTrapezoidProfile/cpp), [Python](https://github.com/robotpy/examples/tree/main/ElevatorTrapezoidProfile)):
