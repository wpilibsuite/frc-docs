Repeatable Low Power Movement - Controlling Servos with WPILib
==============================================================
Servo motors are a type of motor which integrates positional
feedback into the motor in order to allow a single motor to
perform repeatable, controllable movement, taking position
as the input signal. WPILib provides the capability to
control servos which match the common hobby input
specification (PWM signal, 1.0ms-2.0ms pulse width)

Constructing a Servo object
---------------------------

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: java

        Servo exampleServo = new Servo(1);

    .. code-tab:: c++

        frc::Servo exampleServo {1};



A servo object is constructed by passing a channel.

Setting Servo Values
--------------------

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: java

        exampleServo.set(.5);
        exampleServo.setAngle(75);

    .. code-tab:: c++

        exampleServo.Set(.5);
        exampleServo.SetAngle(75);

There are two methods of setting servo values in WPILib:

- Scaled Value - Sets the servo position using a scaled 0 to 1.0 value. 0 corresponds to one extreme of the servo and 1.0 corresponds to the other

- Angle - Set the servo position by specifying the angle, in degrees. This method will work for servos with the same range as the Hitec HS-322HD servo (0 to 170 degrees). Any values passed to this method outside the specified range will be coerced to the boundary.
