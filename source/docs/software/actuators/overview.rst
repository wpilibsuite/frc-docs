Actuator Overview
==================
This section discusses the control of motors and pneumatics
through speed controllers, solenoids and pneumatics, and
their interface with C++ and Java WPILib.

Speed controllers
-----------------
A speed controller is responsible on your robot for making motors move.
For brushed DC motors such as CIMs or 775s, the speed controller regulates
the voltage that the motor receives, much like a light bulb. For
brushless speed controllers such as the Spark MAX, the controller regulates
the power delivered to each "phase" of the motor.

.. .. hint::
..     One can make a quick, non-competition-legal speed controller by
..     removing the motor from a cordless BRUSHED drill and attaching
..     PowerPoles or equivalents to the motor's leads. Make sure that
..     the voltage supplied by the drill will not damage the motor,
..     but note that the 775 is fine at up to 24 volts.

.. warning::
    Connecting a BRUSHLESS motor controller straight to power, such as
    to a conventional brushed motor controller, will destroy the motor!

Pneumatics
----------
Pneumatics are a quick and easy way to make something that's in one
state or another using compressed air. For information on operating
pneumatics, see :doc:`pneumatics`.
