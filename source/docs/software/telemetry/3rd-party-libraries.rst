Several third-party logging utilities and frameworks exist that provide functionality beyond what is currently provided by WPILib:

  * `AdvantageKit <https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit>`__ (Java only): "Log everything"-based logging framework with hooks for replaying logged data in :ref:`simulation <docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction:Introduction to Robot Simulation>`.
  * `Monologue <https://github.com/shueja/Monologue/wiki>`__ (Java only): annotation-based logging library.  Extensive telemetry and on-robot logging can be added to your robot code with minimal code footprint and design restrictions.
  * `DSLOG <https://github.com/orangelight/DSLOG-Reader/tree/master>`__: An alternate driver station log viewer.
