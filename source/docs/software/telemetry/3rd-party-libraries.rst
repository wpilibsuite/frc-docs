Several third-party logging utilities and frameworks exist that provide functionality beyond what is currently provided by WPILib:

  * [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit) (Java only): "Log everything"-based logging framework with hooks for replaying logged data in :ref:`simulation <docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction:Introduction to Robot Simulation>`.
  * [Monologue](https://github.com/shueja/Monologue/wiki) (Java only): annotation-based logging library.  Extensive telemetry and on-robot logging can be added to your robot code with minimal code footprint and design restrictions.
  * [DSLOG](https://github.com/orangelight/DSLOG-Reader/tree/master): An alternate driver station log viewer.
  * [DogLog](https://doglog.dev) (Java only): A simple logging library for Java.
