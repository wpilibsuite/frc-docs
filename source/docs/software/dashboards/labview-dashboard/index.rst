It can be customized using LabVIEW by creating a new Dashboard project.  While it :ref:`can be used <docs/software/dashboards/labview-dashboard/using-the-labview-dashboard-with-c++-java-code:Using the LabVIEW Dashboard with C++/Java Code>` by Java or C++ teams, they generally prefer SmartDashboard or Shuffleboard which can be customized in their respective language.
