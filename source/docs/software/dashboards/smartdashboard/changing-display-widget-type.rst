Changing the Display Widget Type for a Value
============================================

One can change the type of widget that displays values with the SmartDashboard. The allowable widgets depend on the type of the value being displayed.

The new widget type is displayed. In this case, a Line Plot, will show the values of the Arm angle value over time. You can set the properties of the graph to make it better fit your data by right-clicking and selecting ``Properties...``. See: :doc:`Changing the display properties of a value <changing-display-properties>`.
