Mission Statement
-----------------

The WPILib Mission is to enable *FIRST* Robotics teams to focus on writing game-specific software rather than focusing on hardware details - "raise the floor, don't lower the ceiling". We work to enable teams with limited programming knowledge and/or mentor experience to be as successful as possible, while not hampering the abilities of teams with more advanced programming capabilities. We support Kit of Parts control system components directly in the library. We also strive to keep parity between major features of each language (Java, C++, and NI's LabVIEW), so that teams aren't at a disadvantage for choosing a specific programming language.

These docs serve to provide a learning ground for all *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams. Contributions to the project must follow these core principles.

- Community-led documentation. Documentation sources are hosted publicly and the community are able to make contributions
- Structured, well-formatted, clean documentation. Documentation should be clean and easy to read, from both a source and release standpoint
- Relevant. Documentation should be focused on the *FIRST* Robotics Competition.

Please see the :ref:`docs/contributing/frc-docs/style-guide:Style Guide` for information on styling your documentation.

Note on New Articles
--------------------
All new articles will undergo a review process before being merged into the repository. This review process will be done by members of the WPILib team. New Articles must be on official *FIRST* supported Software and Hardware. Documentation on unofficial libraries or sensors *will not* be accepted. This process may take some time to review, please be patient.

Minor revisions and rewrites will be accepted at a more generous rate.
