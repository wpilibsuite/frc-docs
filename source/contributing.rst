Contributing to frc-docs
========================

Welcome to the contributiong guidelines for the frc-docs project. If you are unfamiliar to writing in the reStructuredText format, please read up on it `here <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`__.

.. important:: Currently we are in the process of migrating documentation from the official screensteps. Please hold off on writing new articles unless they are a migration from screensteps. FIRST retains all rights to documentation and images provided. Credit for article will be in the `Github commit history. <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/frc-docs/graphs/commit-activity>`_

Project Goals
-------------

The goal of frc-docs is to have a FIRST Robotics Competition documentation into a community led model.

This community-led model's goals are:

- Community-led documentation. Documentation sources are hosted publicly and the community are able to make contributions
- Structured, well-formatted, clean documentation. Documentation should be clean and easy to read, from both a source and release standpoint
- Relevant. Documentation should be focused on the FIRST Robotics Competition.

Please see :ref:`contributing:Style Guide` for information on styling your documentation. 

Style Guide
-----------

Filenames
^^^^^^^^^

Use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and ``-`` (minus) symbol.

Suffix filenames with the ``.rst`` extention.

.. note:: If you are having issues editing files with the ``.rst`` extension, the recommended text editor is `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`__. Please make sure that `tabs are replaced with spaces <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/455037/convert-tabs-to-spaces-in-notepad>`__, and the space indentation is set to ``3``.

Page References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pages references will be auto-generated based on the page filename and section title. 

For example, given the following file ``contributing.rst`` and a section called ``Page References``, you would reference this by doing ``:ref:`contributing:Page References```
   
Text
^^^^

All text content should be on the same line, if you need readability, use the word-wrap function of your editor.

Whitespace
^^^^^^^^^^

Indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Indentation should *always* match the previous level of indentation *unless* you are creating a new content block.

Indetation of content directives as new line `.. toctree::``  should be `3` spaces.

Blank Lines
~~~~~~~~~~~

There should be ``1`` blank lines seperating basic text blocks and section titles. There *should* be ``1`` blank line seperating text blocks *and* content directives.

Headings
^^^^^^^^

Headings should be in the following strucutre

1. ``=`` for document titles. *Do not* use this more than *once* per article.
2. ``-`` for document sections
3. ``^`` for document sub-sections
4. ``~`` for document sub-sub-sections
5. If you need to use any lower levels of structure, you're doing things wrong.

Code blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^

All code blocks should have a language specified.

1. Exception: Content where formatting must be preserved and has no language. Instead use ``none``.

Links
^^^^^

Links should be in the following format

.. code-block:: none
   
   Hi there, `this is a link <http://example.com>`__ and it's pretty cool!

Images
^^^^^^

Images should be created with ``1`` new line seperating content and directive.

.. code-block:: none
   
   .. image:: images/image-1.png
   
Image Files
~~~~~~~~~~~

Image files should be stored in the document directory, sub-directory of ``images``

They should follow the naming scheme of ``document-title-1.png`` so on and so forth. 

They should be of the ``.png`` or ``.jpg`` image extension. ``.gif`` is acceptable in situations where image motion is required.

Toctree
^^^^^^^

There should be **no** local toctrees in any document. Ever. Additional toctrees are allowed in the following documents when appropriate:

1. ``software.rst``
2. ``hardware.rst``
3. ``networking.rst``
4. ``index.rst`` additions to this are on an approval only basis. 

Examples
^^^^^^^^
   
.. code-block:: none
   
   Title
   =====
   This is an example article
   
   .. code-block:: java

FAQ
---

- Why Sphinx?

  - Because Sphinx is a simply, easy-to-use documentation build system with lots of flexibility and extendability. Other documentation systems such as MkDocs don't have the extendability that this project requires.

- Why reStructuredText?

  - reStruturedText is what Sphinx natively supports

- But... Sphinx supports Markdown through extensions

  - Yes, Sphinx does indeed support Markdown through extensions. However, Markdown has over 50 available flavours with multiple cons. See this excellent article for more information.

- Why was my page involving X not accepted?

  - It contains outdated or bad information
  - It involved unofficial FRC software
  - It contains unacceptable language
  - There was likely a comment regarding why on your Pull-Request. Please review it.
